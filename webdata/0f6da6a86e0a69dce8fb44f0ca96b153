<h3 class="title">Academic Honesty</h3>
<!--	  <p>Do not plagiarize.&nbsp; See <a
	  href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Eciddeweb/FACULTY-DEVELOPMENT/TA_HANDBOOK/end-draft.htm">http://www.pitt.edu/~ciddeweb/FACULTY-DEVELOPMENT/TA_HANDBOOK/end-draft.htm</a> for definition and examples.  <b>Plagiarizers will receive disciplinary actions according to university policies</b>.</p> -->

<p>All submitted work <b>must be your own</b>. In terms of programming
assignments, this means that you must not have any code relevant to
the assignment <i>communicated to you in any form</i>, and that you
are responsible in <i>protecting your work from exploitation by
someone else</i>. In the event of suspected plagiarism, both parties
will be investigated. <b>Plagiarizers will receive disciplinary
actions according to university policies</b>. </p>

<p>You may discuss the assignments with each other <i>in general terms</i>;
you may also refer to printed literature and web resources for
background research. <b>However</b> you must list the names of people
with whom you have had discussions and provide proper citations to any
resources to which you referred.  Failure to do so is considered
plagiarism.

<h3 class="title">Absences</h3>

<p>If an absence is unavoidable, you are responsible for making
arrangements <b>to ensure that your assignments are turned in on time</b>.
You are also responsible for obtaining the materials passed out and the
information announced during the missed class. In case of extraordinary
circumstances (hospitalization, family emergency) you should contact me
as soon as possible so that we may arrange an extension for an
assignment or schedule a make-up exam <i>prior to the due date</i>.
<b>Late assignments will not be accepted.</b> 

<h3 class="title">Final Exam</h3>

<p> Our final exam is scheduled for Dec. 18 (Friday) between
4pm-5:50pm. The exam will only be administered at its scheduled
time. You may not take the exam earlier. If you have a valid reason
for not being able to take the exam at the scheduled time (e.g.,
hospitalization, family emergency), you must make arrangements with me
as soon as possible. Typically, the make-up exam will be given during
Finals Week of the <i>following semester</i>; in the interim, you will
be given an "incomplete" grade.

<h3 class="title">Course Grade</h3>
<p>The course grade will be computed as follows: <br>
<pre>
    <i>Prelim</i> * <i>Overall</i>,
</pre>
where <a
href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/cs1571/prelim.pdf">Prelim</a> is a
preliminary assignment graded on a 1/0 basis.

<p><i>Overall</i> is the sum of the following factors:
<ul>
  <li> Class participation (10%) </li>
  <li> Assignments 1-5 (40%) </li>
  <li> Midterm exam (20%) </li>
  <li> Final exam (30%) </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>There will be ~5 assignments; some will be problem sets, and some
will be programming projects.</p>

<p>The language to use for the programming portion of the assignments
is <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> (v2.7 or later). 

<h3 class="title">Required Textbook</h3>
<p>By <i>required</i>, I mean that you are responsible for the
assigned materials in the specified textbook(s). You have the
perogative to choose any <b>legal</b> means of obtaining the required
information in the textbook (NB: I have reserved a copy of the
textbook(s) in Hillman Library). However, <b>the responsibility of
obtaining the material in a timely manner is yours alone</b>. For
example, if the book you purchased should arrive three weeks late, you
are responsible to find alternative means of accessing the textbook.
Similarly, if you inherited an earlier edition of the book, it is your
responsibility to discover the differences between your version and the
official version. </p>

<h3 class="title">Office Hours</h3>
<p>Aside from the regular office hours, you may request for additional
appointments; however, these appointments must be made at least a day
in advance.</p> 

<h3 class="title">Class Conduct</h3>
<p>Professional behavior is expected from everyone. Please mute your
cell phone during class.&nbsp; Phone rings are disruptive to
lectures because they interrupt everyone's train of thought.</p>

<h3 class="title">Students With Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and
Disability Resources and Services, 216 William Pitt Union, (412)
648-7890/(412) 383-7355 (TTY), as early as possible in the term. DRS
will verify your disability and determine reasonable accomodations for
this course. </p>
