<b>Grading:</b> <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/156/grade/grade.html">Grades</a> are based upon exercises (40%), midterm exam (25%) and quizzes (10%) and final exam (25%).
There will be six sets of exercises of 5% each, and a mini-project of
10%, and exercises generally require access to PC.
In case we cannot have mini-project due to system problems, that
10% will be added to the final exam which then becomes 35%.
<br><br>
<b>Audio-text Lectures</b>: Audio-text lectures are available for some of the
lectures.  You must first download a <a href="../talk.htm"><b>speech agent</b></a>
to your PC.  Then you can download the <b>audio-text lecture</b> (if available) and feed
it to the speech agent.  The audio-text lecture is a text file and therefore
can be quickly downloaded.  The speech agent will use text-to-speech
conversion technique to present the lecture.  You will be surprised at the quality of the audio-text lecture!
You should play the audio-text lecture and read the classnotes at the
same time, because they come hand-in-hand.
Although not a 100% substitute for live lectures, audio-text lectures offer
you the convenience to study at home or at work when you cannot
attend a class.
Some lectures may also be available in true audio format and can
be played using RealPlayer.

<b>For Students who want to register</b>:
If you are a senior undergraduate CS major student, the instructor will first consider
you to register, even if the section is closed.  
Next to be considered will be undergraduate student of junior standing, or graduate student, or students from another
department.  In all cases, please attend the first lecture so that your
name can be added to a waiting list.  If space becomes available, you
will be let in according to above order, on a first-come-first-serve basis.  The final
decision will be made on Week-2-Lec-2.

<br><br><b>If you are a graduate student, you are required
to turn in a <a href="../231/guide.html">project report</a> and give a five-minute project presentation and a live demo.  If you
are an undergraduate student, you are required to turn in a
single-page readme file and give a live demo, but not required to turn in
a project report.</b>
