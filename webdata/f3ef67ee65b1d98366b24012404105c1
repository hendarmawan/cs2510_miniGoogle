<b>Course Description:</b>
This course is one of the courses in the <a href="../SEtrack.htm"> software engineering track</a>.
This course is intended to apply the object-oriented
approach and especially component-based software engineering (CBSE)
to the design of practical software systems.
Students will learn the fundamentals of <a h ref="howmany.html">component-based software engineering</a>
and participate in a group project on software design.
The midterm and final cover the principles of software design methodology
with emphasis on component-based software engineering rather than the traditional
structural approach.

<b>Tools:</b>
You will need to download the following tools.
(1) ArgoUML is Open Source Software, whose official website is:
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/">
http://argouml.tigris.org/</a>.
(2) Virtual Classroom can be found at:
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/cvc/Download/zipfile/vcstu40.zip">
http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/cvc/Download/zipfile/vcstu40.zip</a>.
When you unzip this zip file, it contains the following
two files: StudentTool.exe and config_student.ini.
You can run StudentTool.exe, and enter the login
information of first name, last name and password,
which must match exactly the first name, last name and
password (c????) in your grade vector.

The first four pages of <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/dlearn/v02.htm">"How VC Tool works"</a> explains how the VC Student Tool works.

<b>Special Feature of this Course:</b>
Leading experts from the software industry will
give guest lectures in this course, brining
their experiences and insights to share with
students!  These timely and high relevant
topics are marked in red.</font>

<br><br>
<b>Projects:</b> Projects will apply principles of
component-based software engineering to design the components for personal healthcare system, or a mobile phone voting system.
Following the principles of
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/231/1life/Extreme/01intro.html">Extreme Software Engineering</a>
students will work in pairs on projects.


<p><b>On-line interactions:</b>
In addition to classroom lectures, this course will emphasize
on-line interactions.  In fact, the instructor hopes to offer
this course (and other courses) by distance learning in the
future.  Therefore, on-line interactions will be an important,
necessary component of this course.  The course materials,
announcements and exercises will all  be available from the
Internet.  Impromptu meetings and schedule changes will be
announced by e-mail.
