Project:

I will explore the petri-net tool PIPE2 (Platform Independent Petri net
Editor 2), designed by a group from Imperial College London, which is
Java-based, and open source. Since we have access to the source code, I plan
to modified the PIPE2 to support new function about adding additional
actions(batch file, source code, or XML messages) to places or transitions.
Next, I'm going to model all the setup actions in our SIS test bed to a
petri-net and use PIPE2 to visually control the process. The output of PIPE2
is also pnml, which introduced by Callen. So it might be possible to combine
our projects at the end.

Comments: Good. Talk to Callen Shaw.
