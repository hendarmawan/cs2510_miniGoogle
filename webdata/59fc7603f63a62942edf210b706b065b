<p align="left"><font size="4">This project was just a proof of concept on how to build
relationships between the objects of a Transcript such as WORD, AUTHOR,
DOCUMENT, STATEMENT etc.,</font> </p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">For 6 Transcripts it produced upto 2000 relational indexes
records in MS Access. The time taken to search the key word and transform into
xml took almost 0 millisecs. This time will not be the same when the application
is scaled up with thousands of transcripts. However at this point of time, this
demo application is not designed for more refined and optimized searches.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">However due to the time constraint, the scope was limited to
just Content Word Searching. However this proof of concept can be extended
towards LSI(Latent Semantic Indexing, More qualified searches like search based
on Author ID, Document Reference etc.,</font></p>
