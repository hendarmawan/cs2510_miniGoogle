An ergonomic problem for the plant operators has
appeared in the modern electronic control systems, in which
configure an alarm is very easy. We present a methodology and
an intelligent software tool to manage alarms and make early
fault detection and diagnosis in industrial processes, integrating
three techniques to detect and diagnose faults. The three
techniques use available information in industrial environments:
The alarms of the electronic control system; the fault
knowledgebase of the process, formulated in terms of rules; and a
simplified model used to detect disturbances in the process. A
prototype in a Fluid Catalytic Cracking process is shown.

Abstract: This paper constructs ontologies for smart home to automate home service retrieval
according to the functional properties. By analyzing the context of home service, firstly we
differentiate seven key concepts in the domain and analyze the relations among them, and as a
result, a domain upper ontology as a fixed viewpoint for further more detailed conceptualization is
achieved. Then guiding with the upper ontology, function concept ontology is proposed with
deeply categorization and systematization of functions. Finally a scenario of audible alarm of gas
detective is given to present the architecture for service registry, retrieval and invocation based on
the function concept ontology.
(single seminar.  However, students can look at
related topics of architecture and system for home health care
and give multiple seminars.)

SQL based Knowledge Representation and Knowledge Editor</a>

</h3>
Most of the research work in the area of knowledge representation does not focus on implementation
environment of the knowledge base. Hypothesis of this paper is that implementation environment/
language/ tool, is also critical along with proper representation technique for success of a knowledge
based system. It is based on the premise that .usability. is basic difference between data and
knowledge. .Production rules. is a useful knowledge representation technique, suitable for task
specific knowledge. This paper describes a successful research and development work carried out in
medical billing domain, resulting in a unique and useful system. A rule based expert system has been
developed with .production rules., defined as part of data (not code), has been developed for
identifying errors in medical claims. Structured Query Language (SQL) has been used for the
implementation of production rules. SQL is widely 'used' in almost every system that is related to
database. Success of the system is primarily because of implementation methodology/ environment,
adopted for development of the system. Besides rule engine, a rule editor has also been developed to
facilitate domain experts to feed their knowledge in the system. Although current system has been
developed for medical billing/ medical claim processing domain, but it can be easily applied to any
real life problem domain.

Graph Transformations and Software Engineering:
Success Stories and Lost Chances</a>

</h3>

Textual as well as visual and diagrammatic notations are essential in software engineering, and are used in many different contexts. Chomsky grammars are the key tool to handle textual notations, and many applications for textual languages. Visual and diagrammatic languages add spatial dimensions that reduce the applicability of textual grammars and call for new tools. Graph transformation systems have been studied for over forty years and are a powerful tool to deal with syntax, semantics and transformation of diagrammatic notations. The enormous importance of visual and diagrammatic languages and the strong support that graph transformation provide to the manipulation of diagrammatic notations would suggest a big success of graph transformation in software engineering. In this paper we discuss the main features of graph transformation and how they can help software engineers. We look back to the many attempts to use graph transformations in software engineering in the last fifteen years, identify some success stories, and discuss to what extent graph transformation succeeded, when they have not succeeded yet, what are the main causes of failures, and how they can help software engineering in the next fifteen years.

Software performance engineering deals with the consideration
of quantitative analysis of the behaviour of software systems from
the early development phases in the life cycle. This paper summarizes
in a semiformal and illustrative way our proposal for a suitable software
performance engineering process.  We try to integrate in a very pragmatic
approach the usual object oriented methodology (supported with UML
language and widespread CASE tools) with a performance modelling
formalism, namely stochastic Petri nets. A simple case study is used to
describe the whole process. More technical details should be looked up
in the cited bibliography.

Twitter, a popular microblogging service, has received much
attention recently. An important characteristic of Twitter
is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake
occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related
to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake
occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As
described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction
of events such as earthquakes, in Twitter, and propose
an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target
event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of
tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet,
the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we
produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target
event that can find the center and the trajectory of the
event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor
and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are
widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive
computing. The particle filter works better than other compared
methods in estimating the centers of earthquakes and
the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct
an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because
of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter
users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake
by monitoring tweets with high probability (96% of
earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic
intensity scale 3 or more are detected). Our system
detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered
users. Notification is delivered much faster than the
announcements that are broadcast by the JMA.

Restructuring PL/SQL using Game Theory
</a>

</h3>
Quality of information systems is very essential for the success of any organization. Software can be
given as an example for a live entity, as it undergoes many alterations during its life cycle. Database plays a
major role in any information system and it is the one that gets affected due to the alterations. Relational model
is the popularly used data model in any organization. Any change that alters the relational schema also modifies
the queries that access the relations. In the case of large information system, it is difficult to identify the set of
queries that access the same relation. Our proposed system takes the PL/SQL code as input and suggests how
the procedures can be restructured into package based on the concept of similarity measures, which is one of the
techniques that is used in object oriented programming for refactoring. Our system groups those
queries/procedures that access the same relations into a single package. The objective of our research is to
determine whether the proposed methodology can be used as a mechanism to improve the maintainability of
PL/SQL. This process of packaging is done by applying game theory so as to increase understandability and
maintainability of the system.

As a hub of information controlled by the patient, personal health records (PHR) collect information from the patient medical history including a wide variety of data sources as patient's observations, lab results, clinical findings and in the future maybe even personal genetic data and automatic recordings from monitoring devices. This development will on the one hand make health care more personalized and user controlled but on the other hand also overloads consumers with a huge amount of data. To address this issue we developed a framework for adaptive visual symbols (AVS). An AVS can adapt its appearance and level of detail during the communication process. Finally we demonstrate the AVS principle for the visualization of personal health records.
