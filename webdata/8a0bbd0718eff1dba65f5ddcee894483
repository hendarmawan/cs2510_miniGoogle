<pre>
SQL> CREATE VIEW NUM_OWNED
   2 AS SELECT UNIQUE OWNER_NAME, NUM_PETS(OWNER_NAME) NUM_OF_PETS
   3 FROM PETS_OWNERS;

View created.

SQL> exit

</pre>
<br>
In this example I am creating a new VIEW called NUM_OWNED.<br>
My SELECT statment contains a normal column from PETS_OWNERS and the <br>
value RETURNED from my function NUM_PETS.  A name must be assigned to<br>
the column for the returned value.  Here it is NUM_OF_PETS.  I then <br>
make my selection FROM PETS_OWNERS.  The value passed to NUM_PETS is<br>
the current ROW's OWNER_NAME.<br><br><br>
