<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The system will provide 
  rail traffic information to emergency personnel for routing of emergency vehicles. 
  It will need to provide this information in a variety of formats as the device 
  which will access the information will have varying abilities. Additionally, 
  the conditions under which the system will be used will vary by user.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary information 
  being conveyed in all cases is whether a railroad grade crossing is occupied 
  by a train (i.e. blocking road traffic). If so, then the estimated delay before 
  the crossing becomes passable again is displayed. If the crossing is not occupied, 
  then the estimated time until rail crossing occupation occurs is displayed. 
  In addition, if a crossing is blocked the estimated time until rail crossing 
  occupation is zero which logically follows. Likewise, if the crossing is not 
  blocked, then the estimated delay is reported as zero.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This information can then 
  be used by the emergency services personnel to appropriately route the vehicle 
  to minimize transportation to or from the scene of an ermergency. It may turn 
  out that it is faster for an emergency vehicle to travel to a crossing which 
  is farther from their destination even if that crossing is currently occupied 
  by a train if it is determined that by the time they reach the farther crossing 
  the train is expected to have cleared the crossing. The closer crossing may 
  be expected to be blocked by the time the emergency vehicle can reach it, and 
  would therefore be delayed by the amount of time it would take for the train 
  to entirely pass the crossing. The determination of which crossing to route 
  the emergency vehicle is left up to the user of the system.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The time lost at crossings 
  can be substantial as trains can be very long in length, and in most populated 
  areas lower speed limits are imposed on train traffic to reduce the probability 
  of a catastrophic derailment accident. Combined, these two factors can create 
  a delay which is unacceptable for emergency responses. Additionally, if a vehicle 
  is rerouted to another crossing behind the path of the current train, another 
  train following the first may block it before the emergency vehicle can reach 
  it. In this case, it may actually be beneficial for the emergency vehicle to 
  simply wait for the crossing to be cleared by the current train.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Currently, train location 
  is determined by an AC or DC circuited track. This type of indication does only 
  conveys that a train is currently on that section of track (which may be of 
  substantial length). Along with the train speed limit in that area (or maximum 
  speed limit imposed on the train due to physical limitations or by legal regulations 
  from hazardous payloads, and the length of the train, the system will be able 
  to give an estimated time for the train to traverse a section of track. Future 
  enhancements to the system could be included as new technologies are adopted 
  by railways. Currently some railways are begining to use GPS location on trains. 
  The railway uses the greater accuracy of the GPS units for better planning while 
  relying on old hardware based systems for safety critical tasks. Additionally, 
  integration of GPS location in emergency vehicles could provide the system with 
  enough information to calculate and suggest best route options for the emergency 
  vehicles based on profiles of the type of emergency service, what is considered 
  to be a safe operating speed for the vehicle and the nature of the emergency 
  being to which personnel is responding.</font></p>
