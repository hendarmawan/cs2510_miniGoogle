<ul>

  <li><b>[1/1/12]</b> Welcome to CS 3525!  Please check this web page at least 2 times per week for important announcements.</li>

  <li><b>[1/9]</b>  In case there was any confusion last week, I wanted to clarify that everyone taking CS 3525 for credit should turn in one full paper review per week, and one abbreviated paper review per week.  All reviews are due at the start of class so that you can use them as notes for our discussion.  If you have any questions, email me.</li>

  <li><b>[1/11]</b> The student choice paper for 1/19 is now posted.</li>
  
  <li><b>[2/13]</b> Dates listed on the project page have been updated
  to be consistent with the posted lecture schedule.</li>

<h2>Course Description</h2>

<p>Networked systems are becoming an increasingly prevalent and, in
some cases, intrusive features in our everyday lives. Examples include
online social networks, medical information systems, distributed
sensor networks, and context aware applications. While these systems
certainly provide users with many direct and indirect benefits, they
also expose potentially sensitive personal and corporate data to risks
such as unauthorized disclosure or unintended use (e.g., profiling).</p>

<p>This seminar course will cover recent research that aims to support
the utility of the above types of systems, while still preserving data
confidentiality and respecting user privacy. Specific topics will be
selected from areas such as privacy in social information sharing
systems; location privacy and exposure; privacy as an optimization
criterion in data management systems; private data management; access
control and privacy policy specification and enforcement; security and
fault tolerance; trust, reputation, and collaborative filtering; and
participatory sensing.</p>

<p>Security is an increasingly cross-cutting research area, and papers
will be chosen from a wide range of conferences.  I encourage any
interested students to enroll.  Background will be provided through
reading assignments and in-class discussion.</p>

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Graduate standing. </p>
