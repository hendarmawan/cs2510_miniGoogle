<a id="overview"><h3>Overview</h3></a>

<b>Course description:</b> The course will tentatively cover the following topics: nearest neighbor classification, Hough transform and RANSAC, clustering, discovery, linear models and SVMs, classification, regression, ranking, density estimation, Bayesian belief networks, Hidden Markov Models, Expectation Maximization, decision trees, ensembles, dimensionality reduction, active and transfer learning, information retrieval, and deep learning. The course will include many examples of how machine learning is used in computer vision. The homework assignments will have some bias towards applying machine learning techniques to computer vision problems and datasets.
<br><br>
 
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Knowledge  of  matrices  and  linear  algebra  (CS  0280),  probability  (STAT  1151),  statistics  (STAT 1000), programming and algorithm development and analysis (CS 1501) or equivalent, or the permission of the instructor.

<h4><u>Grading</u></h4>

Grading will tentatively be based on the following components: 

<ul>
<li>Homework and project (60%)</li>
<li>Midterm exam (15%)</li>
<li>Final exam (15%)</li>
<li>Participation (10%)</li>
</ul>

<h4><u>Homework Submission Mechanics</u></h4>

You will submit your homework using CourseWeb. Navigate to the CourseWeb page for CS2750, then click on "Assignments" (on the left) and the corresponding homework number. Attach, in a single zip file, your written responses and code. Name the file as YourFirstName_YourLastName.zip or YourFirstName_YourLastName.tar. Homework is due at 11:59pm on the due date. 

<h4><u>Exams</u></h4>

There will be both a midterm exam and a final exam (the latter of which will mostly focus on material from the second part of the class).

<h4><u>Attendance, in-class participation and discussion</u></h4>

Students are expected to regularly attend the class lectures, and should actively engage in in-class discussions. Your participation grade will be based on what fraction of lectures you attended, and how actively you participated in class. You have two "free" absences that you will not affect your participation grade. If you are absent beyond these, please let me know and explain. You can actively participate by, for example, responding to the instructor's or others' questions, asking questions or making meaningful remarks and comments about the lecture. <i>You are also encouraged to bring in relevant articles you saw in the news.</i>

<h4><u>Late Policy</u></h4>

You get 3 "free" late days, i.e., you can
submit homework a total of 3 days late. For example, you can submit one problem set 12 hours late, and another 60 hours late. Once you've used up your free late days, you will incur a penalty of 25% from the total project credit possible for each late day. A late day is anything from 1 minute to 24 hours. 

<h4><u>Collaboration Policy and Academic Honesty</u></h4>

You will do your work (exams and homework) individually. The work you turn in must be your own work. You are allowed to discuss the problem sets with your classmates, but do not look at code they might have written for the problem sets. You are also not allowed to search for code on the internet, use solutions posted online unless you are explicitly allowed to look at those, or to use Matlab's implementation if you are asked to write your own code. When in doubt about what you can or cannot use, ask the instructor! Plagiarism will cause you to fail the class and receive disciplinary penalty. Please consult the <a href="http://www.provost.pitt.edu/info/ai1.html">University Guidelines on Academic Integrity</a>.

<h4><u>Note on Disabilities</u></h4>

If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and
Disability Resources and Services (DRS), 140 William Pitt Union, (412)
648-7890, drsrecep@pitt.edu, (412) 228-5347 for P3 ASL users, as early as possible in the term. DRS
will verify your disability and determine reasonable accommodations for
this course. 

<h4><u>Note on Medical Conditions</u></h4>

If you have a medical condition which will prevent you from doing a
certain assignment or coming to class, you must inform the instructor
of this <b>before</b> the deadline. You must then submit documentation
of your condition within a week of the assignment deadline.

<h4><u>Statement on Classroom Recording</u></h4>

To ensure the free and open discussion of ideas, students may not record classroom lectures, discussion and/or activities without the advance written permission of the instructor, and any such recording properly approved in advance can be used solely for the student's own private use.
