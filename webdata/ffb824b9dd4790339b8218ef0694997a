Step 1: Requirements specification in terms of IC cards:
Use
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/231/vl01/wwe0.htm">
decomposition rules and transformation rules</a> to
create a collection of IC cards.
(Picnic is a purple card, which can be transformed into many cards)

<p>
Step 2: IC Interactions:
We then specify the interactions between the IC cards.  Result is a relational graph.
In the relational graph, the sub-graphs are the patterns.
(Picnic is a relational graph specifying the interactions  between organizer and attendees)

<p>
Step 3: IC system:
Transform the relational graph into IC system.
In the IC system, the sub-systems are the patterns.
