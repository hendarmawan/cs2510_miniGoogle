<blockquote>First of all, Distributed Project Management tools are incredible
and they change the meaning of project management. After going through
these tools over and over again. I just found these small differences in
the four Distributed Project Management tools that I mentioned above. 

From the above observations I feel that, for Windows environment PlanView,
which is an n-tier software application offers very good project
management with unique facilities, easy and intuitive interface, alert
messages, Resource Search Engine. Since it has the bi-directional link
with Microsoft Project we can also get features like Gantt Chatt.

For Unix environment TeamCenter is better becaouse of Event based
notifications, very interesting Drag & Drop Gannt Schedule and the
facity of never getting 'user lock-out', which are not provided by
WebProject<font size=+0>.</font></blockquote>
