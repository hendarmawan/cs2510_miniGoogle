A computation cycle is a sequence of slow intelligence operators to transform problem sets.

<p>
Starting from an initial problem set Po, the objective of the abstract machine M<sub>sis</sub> for the slow intelligence system is to derive a problem set Pk that is also a solution set, i.e., it contains only solution elements, by applying one or more of the computation cycles cycle1, cycle2, ., cyclen.
