<h1>Basic Concepts of Interface</h1>

<h2>Definition of Interface</h2>

<h2>
An <font color=red>Interface refers to a point of interaction between components</font>, and is applicable at the level of both hardware and software. This allows a component, whether a piece of hardware such as a graphics card or a piece of software such as an internet browser, to function independently while using interfaces to communicate with other components via an input/output system and an associated protocol.
