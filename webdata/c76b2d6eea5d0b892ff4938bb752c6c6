Abstract:

Dapper is a low-overhead system for monitoring the performance of
large, distributed applications constructed from collections
of services and running on hundreds or thousands
of machines.   In this talk I'll discuss the implementation,  tools
we have built to analyze the data, and examples of what
we have learned about Google's systems from using Dapper.
