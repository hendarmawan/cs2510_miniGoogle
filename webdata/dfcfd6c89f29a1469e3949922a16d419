       <LI><FONT size=5>Nowadays people are heavily 
          depending on the road traffic in the life. Traffic crowding has been a 
          serous problem in many years. More broad roads and redirection of the 
          people to the public transportation helps a lot. Another big 
          concerning with the efficient traffic net is the optimized traffic 
          lights. Currently almost all of the currently used traffic lights are 
          hard coded to set up as they are installed. When something unexpected 
          happens, such traffic blocking in the some ways, the policeman may 
          come to open the lights control box to adjust the lights by hand to 
          lesson the blocking problem. Obviously this is not efficient. The best 
          way is to install some kinds of sensors or cameras together with the 
          traffic lights. As sensors detect the traffic flows periodically, the 
          control unit could artificially adjust the lights to adapt to the 
          traffic conditions on time.</FONT>
