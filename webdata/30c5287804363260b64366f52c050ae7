<h3 class="title">Course Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>To understand the impact (both positive and negative) of 
computing technologies on the society</li>
<li>To analyze the ethical questions and issues in public 
policies that it (the impact) generated</li>
<li>To apply critical thinking skills to these complex 
issues in the form of reading, writing, and oral presentations</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Course Grade</h3>
<p>There will be no midterms or final exam for this course.  Instead,
the students will be given two or three writing assignments (3-5
pages) and one final term paper (8+ pages). In addition to the writing
assignments, the students will be given weekly readings. They will
write reaction comments (~1 page) on these readings and participate in
class discussions.&nbsp; These comments will be graded on a basis of
A, B, C, or F.</p>

<p>The overall grade will be decided based on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Class participation (20%) </li>
  <li> Weekly Reading Commentary (15%) </li>
  <li> Writing Assignments (30%) </li>
  <li> Final Term paper (35%) </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Reading Commentary</h3>
<p> Each week, you will be asked to write a short (at a maximum of 300
words) reaction essay for one or two of the readings.  Although you
may provide a brief summary of the major points in the reading, the
emphasis of the essay should be placed on <b>your</b> reaction to
these points. If you agree with the author, discuss further
implications of the main points. If you disagree, explain why you are
not convinced by the author's arguments.  Alternatively, you can pose
questions <i>that are relevant to the reading</i> and predict how the
author will answer your questions.  Although these commentaries are
brief, they should not be informal. Your essay should be
well-organized and to the point.  Proper language usage is expected.
Writings of an inflamatory nature will not be accepted.

<h3 class="title">Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>All submitted work <b>must be your own</b>.  Do not
plagiarize.&nbsp; See <a
href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ciddeweb/ta/ta_handbook/">CIDDE
Handbook</a> for definition and examples.  <b>Plagiarizers will fail
this course and face disciplinary actions according to university
policies</b>.</p>

<p>You may discuss the assignments with each other; you are expected
to refer to printed literature and web resources for background
research. <b>However</b> you must provide proper citations to any
resources to which you referred, including people with whom you have
communicated.  Failure to do so is considered plagiarism.

<h3 class="title">Absences</h3>
<p> Because in-class discussions are an important part of this course,
absences are strongly discouraged. If an absence is unavoidable, you
are responsible for making arrangements <b>to ensure that your
assignments are turned in on time</b>.  You are also responsible for
obtaining the materials passed out and the information announced
during the missed class. In case of extraordinary circumstances
(hospitalization, family emergency) you should contact me as soon as
possible so that we may arrange an extension for an assignment<i>prior
to the due date</i>.  Late assignments <b>will not</b> be accepted. No
make-ups will be given for pop-quizzes</p>

<h3 class="title">Required Textbook</h3>
<p>By <i>required</i>, I mean that you are responsible for the
assigned materials in the specified textbook(s). You have the
perogative to choose any <b>legal</b> means of obtaining the required
information in the textbook.  However, <b>the responsibility of
obtaining the material in a timely manner is yours alone</b>. For
example, if the book you purchased should arrive three weeks late, you
are responsible to find alternative means of accessing the textbook.
Similarly, if you inherited an earlier edition of the book, it is your
responsibility to discover the differences between your version and the
official version. </p>

<h3 class="title">Office Hours</h3>
<p>Aside from the regular office hours, you may request for additional
appointments with the TA and the instructor; however, these
appointments must be made at least a day in advance.</p>

<h3 class="title">Class Conduct</h3>
<p>Professional behavior is expected from everyone. Please mute your
cell phone during class.&nbsp; Phone rings are disruptive to lectures
because they interrupt everyone's train of thought.&nbsp; <i>It is
this course's policy that cell phone rings will signal extra writing
assignments</i>.<br>

<h3 class="title">Students With Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and
Disability Resources and Services, 216 William Pitt Union, (412)
648-7890/(412) 383-7355 (TTY), as early as possible in the term. DRS
will verify your disability and determine reasonable accomodations for
this course. </p>
