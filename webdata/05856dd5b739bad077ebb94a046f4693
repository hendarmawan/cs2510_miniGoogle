<p><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the idea of the user model 
  was introduced in the previous hypermedia presentation 
  <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~syshao/231p/231p-index.html" target="_blank">
  (See it here)</a>, the focus here will 
  be an overview of how the user model is viewed in the Adaptive Hypermedia Application 
  Model.</font></p>
<p><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AHAM User Model</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The user model in the Adaptive 
    Hypermedia Application Model is a list of entities that have associated attribute/value 
    pairs</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A table structure is most often 
    used to represent the user model</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most often concepts from the domain 
    model end up as entities. This seems a bit confusing, but what it means is 
    that domain model related concepts such as <em>&quot;knowledge&quot; (about 
    a concept), read (to denote that a page or fragment was read by the user), 
    or ready-to-read (to denote that the user is &quot;ready&quot; to view information 
    about the concept or to read the page.</em> [WDD01]</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is it persistent or is it 
  volitile?</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The user model actually has a 
    persistent part and a volatile part</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certain entities such as user 
    preferences, or background information would be part of the persistent as 
    they would be changed by the system</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Entities such as &quot;read&quot; 
    or &quot;ready-to-read&quot; maybe calculated, or recalculated at different 
    times during the users session.</font></li>
