<title>Pet Care System</title>
<h2>Pet Care System</h2>
Pet care and patient care systems have a lot in
common.  With a Webcam or a Kinect interface, we can detect
the motion or lack of motion of a pet/patient.
It is also possible to detect whether a patient
has a fall, which should cause the system to send
an alert message.

Pet Care system requirements:
<ol>
<li>
InputProcessor will process input video stream from WebCam at a specified speed
of N frame per second.
<li>
Uploader will upload images  and send alert messages to the pet owner through the Web Server.
<li>
Video images will be processed by PetAbsence to detect the
absence of a pet.
If the pet is absent for a specified Na frames,
an alert message is sent to the pet owner by Uploader.
<li>
Video images will be processed by PetNoMovement to detect the
lack of movement of a pet.
If the pet does not move for a specified Ns frames,
an alert message is sent to the pet owner by Uploader.
<li>
GUI allows the user (pet owner) to specify various
parameters such as N (frame rate per second),
Na (number of frames for absence to trigger an alarm),
and
Ns (number of frames for no movement to trigger an alarm).
<li>
(For experimental purpose, you can select <a href="http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/petcaretest/index.htm">a few images from Prof. Chang's website</a> to test your PetAbsence or PetNoMovement algorithms.)
<li>
(Typical <a href="http://www.campbowwow.com/us/pa/highlandpark/java-viewer">video streams</a> can be observed at the website of Camp Bow Wow.)
