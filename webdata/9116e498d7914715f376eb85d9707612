<h3>Course Description</h3>
<ul>
In this course, we will study the basis of assembly language, the
conversion from assembly language to machine language, the relationship
between the machine language and the machine executing it, how it is possible 
to build a machine that executes instructions, what makes a good architecture
and how we compare architectures.
We will write several programs in MIPS assembly language for the MIPS
R2000/R3000 RISC computer and study at least one program for the 80x86
architecture. We will use the SPIM S20 simulator for the projects.
</ul>

<h3>Textbooks </h3>
<ul>
Computer Organization and Design - The Hardware/Software Interface
<br>
By David Patterson and John Hennessy 
<br>
Second Edition -  Morgan & Kaufmann.
</ul>

<h3>Requirements and grading:</h3>
<ul>
Three exams (50%). 
<br>
Four programming projects (40%)
<br>
Homeworks and quizzes (10%)
</ul>

<h3>Policy on cheating and late homeworks</h3>
<ul>
Programming projects are to be individual efforts. Collaboration
is considered cheating.
Cheating on exam or projects will results in a grade of "0" for the first
time (for all involved students) and an "F" in the course for the second time.
<br>
There will be a 10% per day penalty for late work. Work that
is  more than five days late will not be accepted. Exams will not
be rescheduled except under extraordinary circumstances.
</ul>
