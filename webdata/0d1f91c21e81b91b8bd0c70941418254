<h1>Component-Based Software Engineering: Summary</h1>

<h2>
<font color=red>
CBSE sounds good in principle.  However, if the components are
not trustworthy and you cannot reuse them, then the whole
concept of CBSE becomes meaningless.  Therefore the name of
the game is to develop trusted components.
Trusted components require three things:
<li>
Considerable comprehensive, well-structured
documentation about the component or component infrastructure.
<li>
Component-based software management, with
engineering-trained software engineers and
component-based software project managers.
<li>
Third-party certification, managed by a trusted organizatin with
many years in the field.
