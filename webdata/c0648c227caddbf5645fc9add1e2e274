	<p>Here is our final reading for the semester. Comments are due on 12/1.

<p>Searle, J. R. (1980) <a href="http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/84/bbs00000484-00/bbs.searle2.html">Minds, brains, and programs</a>. <i>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</i> 3 (3): 417-457.

<p>Discussion leads: Andre (12/2) and Sami (12/4).  Andre, please cover Searle's discussions of the first three replies (i.e., the system reply, the robot reply, and the brain simulation reply). Sami, please cover the rest of the article.

	<h3 class="title">Final writing assignment</h3>
	
	<p>For the final writing assignment, you will have to write a longer paper (between 8-10 pages) on a topic of your choice about the social implications of computing. <i>Your paper should argue for a position.</i> Although you have a wide choice of topics, you will have to narrow your focus to something that is appropriate for the scope of an 8-10 page paper. For example, if you decide to write about "censorship," you should explore a particular aspect concerning censorship; do not cram loosely related subtopics (parental control, hate speech, authoritarian governmental censorship) all into one paper. At the same time, you should make sure that your topic is complex enough that you'd have interesting materials to discuss for 8-10 pages. 

<p>By the end of November, you should have already defined the thesis of your paper; you should also have some ideas about how you will structure your paper. The final draft of your paper is due by noon, December 12th. <b>Please email your paper to me as well as to the TA.</b>

<p>If you need some suggestions to get started, take a look at this <a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/giftfire/papertopics">website</a> for a similar class. It contains an extensive list of potential paper topics, and some of them seem quite interesting. <b>Note:</b> although this list is a good starting point for brain-storming, some of the suggested outlines are not well suited for a position paper. So if you wish to pursue one of these suggested topics, you will still have to further refine it into a workable thesis.

	<h3 class="title">Writing Assignment #1</h3>
	
	<p>In his article, <i>Reason, Relativity and Responsibility in Computer Ethics,</i> Moor (1998) argued that computing technologies sometimes bring out situations for which there are policy vacuums.  Johnson (1997), too, conceded that "the issues have a new twist that make them unusual, even though the core issue is not."  Choose an <b>old</b> technology or innovation (e.g., telephone, railroads, electricity), and discuss what issues arose about them.  Analyze the issues in terms of one of the ethical frameworks discussed in Chapter One of CyberEthics (the small text book).  Compare the issues to current concerns about computing technologies.  What solutions have been developed?  To what extent can they help to address the new concerns about computing technologies?

<p>**This topic is based on one of the suggested term paper topics in A Gift of Fire (Baase, 2003).

<h3>Due Dates</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>By noon 9/18</b> you should turn in (via email to the TA) one paragraph on your topic plus a list of <i>at least</i> five references about your chosen technology.
<li> <b>By noon 9/25</b> you should turn in (via email to the TA) a first draft of your full paper. You should also bring two hard copies of your first draft to class.
<li> You will receive two papers written by your classmates. You will have to review them.  A review form will be provided.  <b>By noon 9/30</b> you should send your reviews to the authors of the papers (you should also return to them the edited hard copies).
<li> <b>The full writing assignment is due by noon 10/7</b>  You should turn in all of the following in hard copies in class: the final version of your paper, the two reviews from your reviewers (and the earlier drafts that the reviewers edited).
</ul>

<h3>Guideline</h3>
<ol>
<li> Your paper should be between 3 - 5 pages (about 1000 words).  The paper should express your views.  You should support your position with sound reasoning and evidences.  You are encouraged to use well-reasoned analogies in your arguments (e.g., Moor used money, war, privacy and copyright as examples of informational enrichment), but avoid having just anecdotal evidences as your support.
<li> Use 12-point Times New Roman, with 1.5 line spacing.  The margins should be: 1" for top and bottom, and 1.25" for the sides.
<li> Your paper should be written carefully, using good English style, with proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling.
<li> Divide your paper appropriately into relevant sections, with their own headings of your choosing
<li> Your paper must contain properly formatted citations to the literature, and include a properly formatted bibliography, if appropriate.
</ol>
