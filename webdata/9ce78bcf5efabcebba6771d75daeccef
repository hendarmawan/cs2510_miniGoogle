<h1>Statement of Work: Group 7</h1>
Group 7 will do sound playback.  We envision
controlling sound output with two hands, where hand
depth and height will control such factors as volume
and pitch.  Gestures will select between different
sound types, similar to an electronic keyboard's
sound presets.  Other controls and gestures may be
created as the project develops.
