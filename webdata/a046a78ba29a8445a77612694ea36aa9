        <p><font size="4">Sun Microsystems has proposed a system known as the
        Java Wallet which is part of the Java Electronic Commerce Framework (JECF).&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The JECF is based on a concept that users can
        install <i>cassettes,</i>which are digitally signed (thus trusted and
        secure) containers of JavaBeans that support electronic commerce
        [JavaBus99].</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">A research team at Stanford University has also
        proposed an architecture called SWAPEROO (Simple Wallet Architecture for
        Payments, Exchanges, Refunds, and Other Operation), which is similar in
        design to the Java Wallet, but provides some additional measures they
        felt a consumer would be interested in.&nbsp; [Daswani99].</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The system proposed here is based upon a combination
        of the above two methods.&nbsp; In this paper I look at implementation
        of an e-wallet using the Active Index System (AIS).&nbsp; Specifically,
        I will establish a standard e-wallet based on the above methods, then
        examine each of them from a design perspective using the AIS.&nbsp; This
        examination will look at each component and establish the capabilities
        of the AIS, as well as determining the extensions required to support
        the implementation.</font></td>
