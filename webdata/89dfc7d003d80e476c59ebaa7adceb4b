<ul><b>Cookies have often been accused of being misused.&nbsp; There has
been particular criticism against cookies for their potential to divulge
private information about a user.&nbsp; For example, companies such as
the DoubleClick Network use cookies to track your click trail among all
the sites that have DoubleClick's ads on them.&nbsp; By using this information,
they can discern what your personal interests are and build a profile about
you.&nbsp; They can then make sure that you will be shown peronalized ads
that adhere to your interests.</b></ul>
