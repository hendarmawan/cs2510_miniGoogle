<li>
<b>Maximum Cookie Size</b></li>

<br><b>Cookies can't be used to store arbitrarily large pieces of data.&nbsp;
The maximum size of a cookie is limited to 4KB.&nbsp; To store larger data
sets, you could break the data into several chunks and send each off in
its own cookie.&nbsp; Or, even better, you could store uer data in a database
on the server and send the client only a "cookie receipt".</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Maximum Number of Cookies</b></li>

<br><b>For Netscape, domains can only set a maximum of 20 cookies each
on a specific client.&nbsp; Also, the cookie area may only hold a maximum
of 300 total cookies from all sources.&nbsp; For each cookie past the limits,
the least recently used cookie is deleted.&nbsp; Some browsers can store
more than 300 cookies.</b></ul>
