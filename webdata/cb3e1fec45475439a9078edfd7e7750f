<font color=red>1. Start from UML Class Diagram:</font>
We can use UML to model the logical representation of a software component
The key point is to use UML class diagram to
model a subsystem as a package.  See Chapter 14
(<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/c14/AK07.htm">http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/c14/AK07.htm</a>)

<font color=red>2. End with UML Deployment Diagram:</font> The deployment component diagram can be
traced back tothe UML component. See Chapter 14
(<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/c14/AK072.htm">http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/c14/AK072.htm</a>)

<font color=red>3. Consider Business Logic:</font> From the business point of view, we want to design
an application system using off-the-shelf components.
If we are designing a web-based application, the
off-the-shelf components are actually web services
provided by various vendors.  See lecture on SOA
(<a href="lecSOA.ppt">lecSOA.ppt</a>).

<p>
<font color=red>4. Take Top Down Approach:</font>
How do we design such soffware system?
The answer is still to use the class diagram.
We can start from coarse-grained components, and
refine them into are fine-grained components.  See Chapter 16
(<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/c16/bc3.html">http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/c16/bc3.html</a>).

<p>
<font color=red>5. Decide Software Architecture:</font>
At the same time, we need to look into the software
architecture.  See Chapter 20
(<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/c20/c02.htm">http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/c20/c02.htm</a>).
The business logic may dictate a piped software architecture.
If there is shared database, it may dictate a share repository.
The need to use legacy systems may dictate layered abstract machines (like an onion).

<p>
<font color=red>6. Grow from Core Components:</font>
Finally, we need to consider how you grow the system
starting from a software component infrastructure.  See Chapter 21
(<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/c21/c02.htm">http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/c21/c02.htm</a>).
Another good example is the <a href="interface/SequenceSIS.htm">Personal HealthCare System</a> project.
