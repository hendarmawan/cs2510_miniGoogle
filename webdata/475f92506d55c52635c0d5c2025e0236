* wxWindows was started in 1992 at the Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute <http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk>, University of Edinburgh, by Julian Smart <http://www.anthemion.co.uk>. <br><br>
* Julian was designing a kind of meta-CASE tool called Hardy which needed to run on Windows as well as X-based Unix workstations. 
The existing commercial cross-platform tools were deemed too expensive for an in-house experimental project, so the only alternative was to build one. 
wxWindows (w for Windows, x for X) started off with support for XView and MFC 1.0, and AIAI allowed it to be released to the Internet. <br><br>
* Over time, a small but enthusiastic community of wxWindows users was established and a mailing list set up.
 Contributions and fixes were sent in, it gradually picked up more and more 
users from all over the world: commercial, government, and - most gratifying of all - company users who found that wxWindows offered a better product, 
and better support, than the commercial products they had looked at or used. <br><br>
* Towards the end of 1997, Julian Smart started distributing a CD-ROM <cdrom2.htm> of wxWindows. <br><br>
