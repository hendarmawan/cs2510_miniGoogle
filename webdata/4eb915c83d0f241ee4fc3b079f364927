SPECIAL ISSUE ON Social Media as Sensors
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA

INTRODUCTION:
Web 2.0 applications and social media have transformed the Web into an interactive sharing platform
where users upload data and media, comment on and share  this content within their social circles. Each
content item is associated with an abundance of metadata and related information such as location, tags,
comments, favourites, access patterns and logs etc. At the same time all this information is implicitly  or
explicitly interconnected based on various properties such as social links between users, groups,
communities, etc. These properties transform social media to data sources of an extremely dynamic
nature that reflect topics of interests, events, and the  evolution of community opinion and focus. Social
media offer a unique opportunity to structure and extract information and to benefit multiple areas
ranging from computer vision to sociology and marketing.

SCOPE:
This special issue targets a mixed audience of researchers from several communities, i.e. computer vision,
multimedia analysis, data mining, machine learning, information extraction, social networks, complex
systems, and information retrieval. The emphasis of the special issue is on recognition, discovery, and
detection of topics and real-world events, as well as on monitoring and prediction of trends and events
using social media sites as sensors. Both theoretical contributions and applications validated on
larges-cale social media datasets are welcome.

TOPICS:
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Scalable and multimodal social media analysis
- (Near) real-time social media analysis
- Data mining and knowledge extraction from social media
- Community detection and clustering in social media
- Spatio-temporal analysis for event discovery and detection
- Social media applications for prediction and monitoring
- Behaviour analysis in social media
- Analysis of world events from social media streams
- Social media systems applied to political analysis, emergency management, and news generation
- Social media as a source for sensing reality
- Social media enabled applications (e.g. tourism, augmented reality, e-participation, etc)
- Other applications of social media as sensors
