 <H1>Introduction </H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>requirements of the model are as follows:
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>complexity of the presentation should be preserved among platforms
<UL>
<LI> This includes specifications of media items used, temporal and
spatial relations among them.
</UL><LI> complexity should be the middle path of 2 extremes
<UL>
<LI>if too complex: it becomes difficult to use and specify for a
particular presentation; however, very flexible
<LI>if too simple: it will be easy to use;
yet, becomes too restrictive</UL></UL></UL></P>
<P><UL>
<LI><H2> We need to preserve the interactivity of a presentation
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>passive interaction: watching a video (no user interaction)
<LI>active interaction: playing a video game ( highly interactive with the
user)
<LI> Should keep the interaction in the middle, for example user looking
at a presentation that let's the user makes choices. If the user does not
make choices, the presentation plays on.
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2> This interaction of the user, 
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>demands the transmission of data and the synchronization of the
constituent media items
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2> which inplies that the model need to have time relations</H2>
</UL></P>
