<p><font color="#000000" size="4">The reason why these libraries
fall prey to DLL Hell is that neither the applications nor the
libraries they use are self-containing or self-describing and
uncontrolled component sharing.</font></p>

<h2>.NET vs. DLL Hell</h2>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">All applications are self-describing. This
        eliminates the central registry, and thus simplifies
        install replication and uninstall.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Version information regarding application
        library usage and the libraries themselves are enforced,
        to ensure that applications load the appropriate version
        of the libraries they need.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">.NET remembers the &quot;last known good&quot;
        - the last component and version combination known to
        have successfully worked with an application.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">.NET supports &quot;side-by-side&quot;.
        Component callers may explicitly specify the version they
        need to load, or may allow .NET freedom to locate the
        most recent version of a component they need. This means
        that multiple versions of the exact same component may
        exist on a system without conflict with each other.</font><ul>
            <li><font size="4">The .NET Framework itself is
                versioned in this manner. Hence, it too can be
                upgraded and improved without fearing system
                breakdown.</font></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><font size="4">Isolation of applications are supported.
        Changes libraries internal to one application have no
        effect on another (more or less given). Changes to shared
        libraries used by multiple applications will only affect
        those applications that allow it.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="4">.NET accomplishes this through its basic unit
of logical functionality: the &quot;assembly&quot;.</font></p>
