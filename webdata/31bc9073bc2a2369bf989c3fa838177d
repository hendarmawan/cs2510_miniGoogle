Tips for Compiling IC_Manager and running MICE:

1. If you are using the Unix version, first you want to make sure that
the machine you compile on, and the server are the same type. Second,
"Internal Server Error" may be the result of not giving AFS access
to the work directory.  The work directory needs: rlidw because:
   i - to insert file.ic and dumpfile
   d - to delete file.ic (clear.cgi)
   w - to write file.ic and dumpfile
On the other hand TAOML only needs rl. Third, use Netscape rather than IE.
Finally, the flag IC_TRACE in ic.h is defined as
  #define IC_TRACE 1
This can be commented out if you don't want debug messages to print on
to the browser.

2. To compile on Linux m/c, the following changes should be made:
a) In Makefile.intercgi the "-ll" flag must be removed as linux doesn't
like this flag
b) In the file cgienv.c the line
   extern char *sys_errlist[];
must be replaced by
   extern const char *const sys_errlist[];
This is causing error as in linux this array is declared like this in
stdio.h.

3. The versions of cgienv.c for UNIX and windows are somewhat
different. Be sure to use the right version. In the windows version,
there is the following definition of S_ISDIR:
   #ifndef S_ISDIR
   #define S_ISDIR(x) (((x)&_S_IFDIR)==_S_IFDIR)
   #endif

4. If you are using PC version now it has a Taoml Interpreter:
  - Taoml interpreter is added to icm.zip.
  - Folder "taoml interperter" 
  - PC version
  - See http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~jung/IC_Taoml/README.ICT.html for the details.
  - icm.cgi.exe is the executable file of the Taoml interpreter.
