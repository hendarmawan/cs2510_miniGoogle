Title:	Workshop on the Analysis of System Logs 2008
<br />
Submission Deadline:	2008-09-08
<br />
Webpage:	www.systemloganalysis.com
<br />
Dates:	12/7/2008
<br />
Location:	San Diego, CA, USA
<br />
Contact Email:	greg&#64;bronevetsky.com
<br />
Synopsis:
<br />
System logs are a rich information source for analyzing and diagnosing system 
<br />
problems and predicting future events. However, most of this information is 
<br />
wasted due to their lack of organization or cross-vendor semantic consistency. 
<br />
This workshop focuses on novel techniques for extracting operationally useful 
<br />
information from existing logs and methods to improve the information content 
<br />
of future logs. Topics: Reports on publicly available log sources Log 
<br />
anonymization Log feature detection and extraction Prediction of malfunction or 
<br />
misuse Statistical log characterization Log compression/comparison Methods to 
<br />
enhance and standardize log semantics Diagnostic techniques Log visualization 
<br />
Analysis of services (problem ticket) logs

<br />
Title:	Workshop on Power Aware Computing and Systems
<br />
Submission Deadline:	2008-09-11
<br />
Webpage:	<a href="http://www.usenix.org/event/hotpower08/cfp/cfp.html">http://www.usenix.org/event/hotpower08/cfp/cfp.html</a>
<br />
Dates:	December 7, 2008
<br />
Location:	San Diego, CA, USA
<br />
Contact Email:	hotpower08chair&#64;usenix.org
<br />
Synopsis:
<br />
Power is increasingly a central issue in designing systems, from embedded 
<br />
systems to data centers. We do not understand energy and its tradeoff with 
<br />
performance and other metrics very well. This limits our ability to further 
<br />
extend the performance envelope without violating physical constraints related 
<br />
to power, heat generation, or cooling. This workshop provides a forum to 
<br />
present the latest research and to debate directions, challenges, and novel 
<br />
ideas about building energy-efficient computing systems, addressing issues 
<br />
related to architecture, systems and networking, measurement and modeling, 
<br />
language and compiler design, and embedded systems. HotPower 08 will be 
<br />
co-located with OSDI 08.

<br />
Synopsis:
<br />
The 3rd International Workshop on Real Overlays And Distributed Systems (ROADS) 
<br />
seeks papers on the challenges in building large-scale distributed systems and 
<br />
networking overlays. ROADS is a place to share new experiences, and work in 
<br />
progress, with an emphasis on systems that actually run in the wide-area 
<br />
Internet. We encourage submissions of early work containing novel and 
<br />
interesting ideas. We envision ROADS as a forum where participants can receive 
<br />
early feedback on the design and implementation of systems that may later form 
<br />
the core of conference submissions.

<br />
Synopsis:
<br />
Join us in San Diego, CA, December 10
<br />
11, 2008, for the First Workshop on I/O Virtualization. Over the past decade, 
<br />
the use of virtualization technology has grown rapidly. Moreover, it is being 
<br />
used in a variety of places, ranging from the data center to the desktop. 
<br />
Although this has spurred great advances in processor and memory virtualization 
<br />
in commodity hardware and virtualization software, I/O virtualization has 
<br />
received far less attention. This workshop is meant to provide a forum to 
<br />
discuss challenges of I/O virtualization that span the virtual machine monitor, 
<br />
guest operating system, processor, memory subsystem, and I/O subsystem.

Contact Email:	garth&#64;cs.cmu.edu
<br />
Synopsis:
<br />
Held in conjunction with SC08 (sc08.supercomputing.org). Petascale computing 
<br />
infrastructures make petascale demands on information storage capacity, 
<br />
performance, concurrency, reliability, availability, and manageability. This 
<br />
one-day workshop focuses on the data storage problems and emerging solutions 
<br />
found in petascale scientific computing environments. The petascale data 
<br />
storage workshop holds a peer reviewed competitive process for selecting 
<br />
extended abstracts and short papers (2-5 pages). The workshop proceedings will 
<br />
be published in association with SC08 in the IEEE digital library.

Location:	Athens, Greece
<br />
Contact Email:	serpanos&#64;ece.upatras.gr
<br />
Synopsis:
<br />
Opportunities and challenges for realizing highly complex, efficient and 
<br />
dependable business and control systems have been steadily increasing, driven 
<br />
by the growth in the power, intelligence, adaptiveness and openness of 
<br />
technologies applied in computing, communication and control systems. Dynamic 
<br />
social and economic situations demand the next-generation of systems to be 
<br />
based on adaptive and reusable technologies and applications and to have the 
<br />
characteristics of living systems composed of largely autonomous and 
<br />
decentralized systems (ADS). ISADS 2009 will cover all topics of the ADS 
<br />
concept, technologies and applications and will focus on networked embedded 
<br />
systems. The topics are described at: <a href="http://www.ece.upatras.gr/isads2009/">http://www.ece.upatras.gr/isads2009/</a>

<br />
Location:	Boston, MA, USA
<br />
Contact Email:	nsdi09chairs&#64;usenix.org
<br />
Synopsis:
<br />
NSDI focuses on the design principles and practical evaluation of large-scale 
<br />
networked and distributed systems. Systems as diverse as Internet routing, 
<br />
peer-to-peer and overlay networks, sensor networks, Web-based systems, and 
<br />
measurement infrastructures share a set of common challenges. Progress in any 
<br />
of these areas requires a deep understanding of how researchers are addressing 
<br />
the challenges of large-scale systems in other contexts. Our goal is to bring 
<br />
together researchers from across the networking and systems community
<br />
including communication, distributed systems, and operating systems
<br />
to foster a broad approach to addressing our common research challenges.

Synopsis:
<br />
The Tenth Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (HotMobile) 
<br />
continues the series of highly selective, interactive workshops focused on 
<br />
mobile applications, systems, and environments, as well as their underlying 
<br />
state-of-the-art technologies. HotMobile's small workshop format makes it ideal 
<br />
for presenting and discussing new directions or controversial approaches. We 
<br />
solicit submissions of position papers that focus primarily on applications and 
<br />
systems and that propose new directions of research, advocate non-traditional 
<br />
approaches to old (or new) ideas, or generate controversy and discussion. 
<br />
Submissions will be judged based upon originality, technical merit, topical 
<br />
relevance, and likelihood of leading to insightful discussion at the workshop.

<br />
Synopsis:
<br />
The First USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Parallelism (HotPar '09) will bring 
<br />
together researchers and practitioners doing innovative work in the area of 
<br />
parallel computing. Parallel architectures can potentially mitigate the 
<br />
problems of poor energy performance of conventional microprocessors, but this 
<br />
new computer architecture will only be successful if languages, systems, and 
<br />
applications can take advantage of parallel hardware. We request submissions of 
<br />
position papers that propose new directions for research of products in these 
<br />
areas, advocate non-traditional approaches to the problems engendered by 
<br />
parallelism, or potentially generate controversy and discussion.

<br />
Synopsis:
<br />
The interaction among operating systems, compilers, and multicore processors is 
<br />
becoming more tightly bound and sophisticated. The tremendous advances in 
<br />
process technology are providing architects and microarchitects with many 
<br />
interesting opportunities for making use of the huge transistor budget to 
<br />
enhance performance and increase throughput. However, system software is 
<br />
becoming more complex and difficult to scale. Therefore, a pressing need exists 
<br />
for innovative techniques to redefine the interaction among the three major 
<br />
entities in modern computer systems: the operating system, the compiler, and 
<br />
multicore processors.

he JSSPP workshop, regularly ranked in the top 10% of Citeseer's impact lists,

<br />

<br />
and clusters, but also emerging platforms and paradigms, such as multi-core and 
<br />
many-core systems, virtualization, Grids, and cloud computing. Please see
