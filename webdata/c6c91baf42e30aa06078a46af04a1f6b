<font color=red>
The Active Index is an extended Petri net model.
Instead of having <b>fixed connections</b> between
places and transitions, the active index allows
index cells to be <b>instantiated</b> as they
are needed.
<br><br>
Therefore, one index cell can send a message to another
index cell type.  If no appropriate index cell instance exists,
an index cell will be instantiated.
</font>
<br><br>
For example, if an <b>enumerator</b> index cell wants to
create several hundred <b>solution</b> index cells,
it can send messages to instantiate such solution
index cells.
<br><br>
In what follows, we will first give the formal
definitions of an active index cell, and
then present an example of a simple active
index system for distance learning.
