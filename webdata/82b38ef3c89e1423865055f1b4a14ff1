<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scenario is organized in two parts: (1) a presentation of 
the company (called Company) and (2) a presentation of the mascot proposal 
(called Mascot). These two parts of the scenario can be read sequentially but 
hypermedia links allows the reader to jump at any time from one part of the 
document to the other. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company part should globally last about 3 minutes. It is 
composed of a sequence of three objects: an audio clip(History) which gives the 
history of the company, followed by a textual message displaying the name of the 
company on the screen (Name) and ends with a graphic listing its main 
achievements (PressBook). History audio lasts for approximately 1 minute, Name 
and PressBook must be each one displayed during 45 seconds at least. In addition 
to this first specification, the author added a 2 minutes movie that gives an 
overview
of the company together with its geographical localization 
(called Geography). This movie must be started so that the mapping of the Name 
on the screen is synchronized with the period of the Geography movie when the 
company building appears (approximately 20 seconds from its beginning).
</font>
</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Agency FB" size="5">The Mascot part is mainly composed of a virtual animation of 
the proposal (Animated Proposal). This animation ends with a last picture of the 
mascot (Proposal). This last frame remains displayed on the screen during 30 
seconds together with a balloon (Balloon) on the right of the mascot mouth, 
which contains its name. In addition, in order to see the mascot name faster, 
the reader is asked by an audio message (Message) to click on a button (Button) 
during the presentation of the Animated Proposal. When the reader clicks on the 
button, the audio message stops and the balloon appears at the top of the screen 
and moves until it reaches its final position (near the mouth of the mascot) 
exactly when the animation ends.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Agency FB" size="5">Figure1 gives a possible execution of this 
document in which the reader of the document has interacted twice. At second 
140, after the beginning of the document, he jumped to the Mascot part (cropping 
the presentation of the Company Press-book) and, at the 180th second, he 
activated the button to see the mascot Name faster. As a consequence, the name 
appears on a balloon at the top on the screen and moves during such a period of 
time that it stops exactly when the animated proposal ends. </font> </p>
