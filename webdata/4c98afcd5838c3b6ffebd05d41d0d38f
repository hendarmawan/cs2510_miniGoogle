<p><font size="4">First, take a look at what Microsoft is hoping
.NET will be. Later, a we will have detailed look at how two core
concepts of .NET will help it achieve these goals.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Microsoft .NET is designed to act as an XML
&quot;Web Services&quot; platform. We will see more about &quot;web
services&quot; later. But for now, what does it mean to say that
.NET is an &quot;XML web services platform&quot;?</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">Right now, integration across applications
        is very difficult due to proprietary standards and
        technologies. .NET is built on open standards (e.g. XML)
        and embraces many programming languages.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Because of proprietary standards,
        applications have a hard time exchanging data or acting
        upon it. By using XML, .NET makes it easier to exchange
        and understand application data and provides the API to
        work with it.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">XML is also employed by .NET to provide
        general application interoperability, integration, and
        extensibility.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Personal information and other data are
        not under your control on the web. .NET allows management
        of the privacy of such information through various
        services.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Dot-coms and web site development have
        hard time providing value to users, partly because web
        sites that would like to work together often can't - they
        are like disconnected islands. .NET will allow a web site
        to collaborate together and aggregate the value of
        services of many sites to increase the value of their own.</font></li>
</ul>
