<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The TA(s) 
  is your first source of information. If you have questions about the
  labs, recitations, exams, class lectures, etc., you should check first

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Description</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
The purpose of this course is to study the components of computing
systems common to most computer architectures. In particular, this
class is meant to introduce data representation, types of processors
(e.g., RISC V. CISC), memory types and hierarchy, assembly language,
linking and loading, and an introduction to device drivers.
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Textbook</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Computer Organization 
  and Design - The Hardware/Software Interface</i>, John Hennessy and David Patterson, 
  <b>FIFTH EDITION</b>, Morgan Kaufmann. <b>Be sure to buy the correct
  book edition. </b> </font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  <p>
  There will also be supplemental material in some lectures -- you are
  responsible for all information presented in class.
</p></font>

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simulator</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
We will use a MIPS simulator to run your assembly language programs.  The simulator is
MARS from Pete Sanderson and Ken Vollmar.  You can get the simulator from their 
<a href="http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/index.htm">web site</a>.  I
suggest that you install the simulator on your computer as you'll need it throughout
the semester. 
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
We will also use a logic simulator, called Logisim, in the second half of the semester. This
simulator will be used in the last course project on how to implement a MIPS processor. You
can get Logisim from this <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/index.html">web site</a>.
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Requirements and Grading</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
The course includes exams, labs, and programming and circuit design 
projects. No extra credit will be offered. The grade distrbution 
is: </font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<ul>
<li>Exam 1/2/3 (15%/15%/20% of grade)</li>
<li>Labs (20% of grade)</li>
<li>Quizzes (5% of grade, given weekly in recitation)</li>
<li>Programming/design projects (10%+15% of grade)</li>
<!-- <li>(Bonus) Class participation/attendance (5% of grade)</li>  !-->
</ul>

</font><p></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may ask to have 
  an exam, project or lab regraded. <i>However, the entire exam, project or lab will be 
  regraded. This may or may not result in a grade change, either up or down. </i>To 
  have an assignment regraded, you must hand in the item with 
  a <i>typewritten paragraph </i>explaining what was not graded correctly. 
  You must ask for the regrading <i>by</i> the 
  <i>next class period</i> after the project, lab, or exam was returned.
  There will be no exceptions to this requirement.
</font></p>


<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Exams</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
There will be three exams: two mid-term exams and one final exam. The final exam is 
comprehensive: It covers all material in the course.  The tentative exam dates are
listed on the schedule. The final exam date is set by the University.  If you are
taking more than two finals on the same day, you must talk to your instructor
at least two weeks before the final exam to make accommodations. Final exam
dates are already known for all hourly courses; consult the University
Registrar's course schedule and web pages for details.
</font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
You must take all exams in the lecture session for which you are registered.
</font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<i>Exams are closed book and an individual effort.</i> You may use a simple non-programmable 
calculator.   The use of simple calculators is recommended: The exams will require computing 
many values and it will be hard to do so without a calculator.   
</font></p>


<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Labs</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Labs will be conducted during recitation. The lab assignments will be 
distributed in recitation and turned in electronically by the due
date stated on the lab.
More information about the submission process will be given in
the first recitation. A solution will be posted on the TA's web 
site for each lab within one to two weeks of the due date.
</font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
There will be twelve labs; the lowest two lab grades will be dropped (i.e., 
you can miss up to two labs without penalty).  Points will be given for
attendance on the lab assignments. <i>We may grade labs in
the recitation as a group. If you miss this grading, your lab will be
recorded as a 0.</i>   This policy is intended to encourage you to regularly 
attend recitation.
</font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<!--
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Late lab assignments (without a valid University excuse - see below) will 
not be accepted since you can miss up to two labs without penalty.  
</p>
--->
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
You are allowed to collaborate with a partner in the lab unless noted
otherwise.  However, each person must turn in their own copy of the 
lab, with the name of their partner.  <b>Both names (your name and
your partner's name) must appear on the assignment.</b>
 <!-- On "written labs", the lab is individual effort and you are
not allowed to collaborate. We will clearly mark the labs about whether
you can work with a partner or must work alone.
-->
</font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Projects</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
There will be two projects -- one programming projects and one design project. 
The programming projects will require that you write significant assembly language 
programs.  The design project will require you to implement a significant logic circuit. 
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
You must follow the requirements given in the projects to receive partial credit.
</font></p>


<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
The projects will be posted on the CS 447 web site on the day that they 
are assigned.  
The TA's web site may also give hints about the more difficult problems.
  If you have questions, be sure to ask early. There's no guarantee that
 we can reply to questions at the last minute before a late night 
submission deadline.
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Solutions will not be provided for the programming and design projects.
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
You are responsible for visiting the main course and TA web sites to get the
projects, solutions, and hints.  
</font></p>
<!--
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<i>Projects (without a valid University excuse - see 
below) will be accepted up to five days late (with a 20% penalty each 
day)</i>, so plan accordingly. </font></p>
-->
<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Late Assignments</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  A late assignment with a valid written excuse according to University
  rules will be accepted up to one week late without a penalty. Because
  two labs can be missed without penalty, late labs will not be accepted. 
 <!-- 
  <b>Late projects will not be accepted unless arrangements, due to a
  compelling reason, are made in advance.</b> </font></p>
-->
  <b>For non-preapproved excuses, late projects incur 20% deduction per day.</b> </font></p>



<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
There will be no early exams. Make up exams must be pre-approved. No 
  make up exams will be given that do not meet University rules and have 
  proper (written) documentation.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  All make up work (exams, projects) must be completed within 
  one week of the original assignment. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as an extended multi-week
illness, other accommodations can be made for the course and this
policy can be amended to permit some flexibility for completing
the missed work.
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Collaboration</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<b>All exams and projects (unless otherwise noted) are individual 
efforts.</b>  For projects, it is acceptable to talk with a fellow student 
about how to approach an assignment.     It is not acceptable to collaborate 
on the actual assignment, such as writing a program  together or reviewing 
each other's logic design. As noted above, you may collaborate with one 
other person (i.e., your lab partner) on a lab provided both names are
listed on the assignment.  
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  <b>Viewing, copying or modifying assembly language or logic projects 
     from previous offerings of CS 447 is considered collaboration.</b>
<!--
     This includes the use of materials from previous iterations of the
     course for which you were enrolled.
-->
     Similarly, be careful how you use Google.  Using code or logic solutions
     from the web or other sources is collaboration.  This kind of
     collaboration is not allowed by  the policy of individual work. Be
     sure to secure your work; it is your responsibility to properly 
     set permissions on your files, avoid losing USB drives, leaving
     print-outs on printers, etc. 
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  Any deviation from the policy of individual work is considered cheating.
  The first case of cheating will result in a 0 for the assignment. A second
  case will result in an F for the course.
  If warranted,  the appropriate Dean's office (ECE or FAS) will be
  notified.  All parties involved in an incident will be considered to have 
  cheated.  
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  If you have any doubts about what is "cheating", ask the instructor 
  for clarification before you do it.  The instructor will make the final
  determination of what is considered cheating.
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  We may use automated techniques to easily detect cheating.
</font></p>


<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attendance</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attending class 
  is vital to success! It is unlikely you will do well in the 
  course unless you attend lectures. You are responsible for all material 
  presented in lecture, including material not directly covered in the 
  textbook. If you must miss a class, you should ask your classmates for 
  course notes. The instructor will not provide course notes. Extra credit
  may be occasionally offered in class.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are three recitations. 
You should direct your questions to the TA
for your registered recitation.  There is no switching allowed between
recitations unless you have the permission of the instructor.  Lab space
is very limited so we will strictly follow this policy.  
<!-- You may, however,
attend different lectures.  Nevertheless, this is discouraged due to limited
seating in the lecture room.  Students registered for a lecture get
first priority for a seat. 
!-->
<b>Exams must be taken in your registered
lecture session.</b> If you take the exam in the wrong lecture, it will
not be graded and you will receive a 0 for the exam. 
 </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">File Backups</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
It is your responsibility to backup your work regularly.  Please consider using reliable 
and multiple ways to protect your files!  No extensions for
assignments will be approved due to failed laptops, hard drive crashes, lost 
USB drives, or other calamities that lead to lost or corrupted data.  Per the 
policy on late assignments, you may turn in a project up to five days late (with a penalty), which 
should give sufficient time to recover a lost/corrupted project.  
</font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cell Phones, Laptops, Tablets (&amp; other electronic devices)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Turn off
your cell phone, tablet, laptop, etc., before lecture starts.  
<b>If you want to
use a laptop, tablet, cell phone or recording device to take notes, you must 
ask the instructor for permission.</b>
