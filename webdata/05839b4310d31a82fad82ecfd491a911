<H1>Plan-Based Interfaces</H1>
<p>
Plan recognition is an active research area in automatic reasoning, as
well as a promising approach to engineering better interfaces in the
area of natural language understanding as well as in a wide variety of
other application areas.  However, exactly what kind of interface
tasks plan recognition can be used to support across domains and
communication modalities, and how such tasks in turn constrain plan
recognition algorithms, are questions that have typically remained
unexamined.
<p>
In my work in plan-based natural language understanding, I developed a
knowledge-based approach to the understanding of subdialogues such as
clarifications and corrections.  In particular, I developed a plan
recognition system that could infer discourse plans (which represented
how utterances could relate to a topic) as well as the traditional
domain plans (which represented the topic).  Incorporating knowledge
of discourse into the plan-based framework enabled the understanding of
a wide variety subdialogues, while maintaining the computational advantages
of the plan-based approach.  In other work I generalized the use of
plan recognition, by developing a graphical plan-based interface for
design.  I identified how plan recognition made interfaces more
intelligent and interactive (by supporting advice generation, task
completion, context-sensitive responses, error handling), and showed
how interface tasks constrained plan recognition.
