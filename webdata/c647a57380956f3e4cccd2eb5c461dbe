<H1>Predicting and Adapting to Problematic Dialogues</H1>
<p>

Spoken dialogue system performance can vary widely for different
users, as well for the same user during different dialogues.  Since
the dialogue strategies used by a system strongly
influence performance, an ideal system would not use a single fixed
strategy, but would instead adapt to the circumstances at hand.  To do
so, a system must be able to identify dialogue properties that suggest
adaptation.  For instance, a system that detects poor speech
recognition performance for a particular user might switch to a
dialogue strategy with more explicit prompting.
<p>
We have used a machine learning approach to predict when 
a system should adapt its dialogue strategies, using only features
automatically available at
system run-time. In particular, based on human-machine training dialogues, we have learned rules 
for identifying situations where speech recognition is
performing poorly, and where the system should "bail out" to a human
operator. Our results show a significant improvement over baseline
approaches, and illustrate how the use of different knowledge sources
(e.g., lower-level acoustic features, higher-level dialogue features)
can impact performance.
<p>
To apply our learned rules, we have designed and evaluated an adaptive version of TOOT, a spoken
dialogue system for retrieving online train schedules.  Based on rules
learned from a set of training dialogues, adaptive TOOT constructs a
user model representing whether the user is having speech recognition
problems as a particular dialogue progresses.  Adaptive TOOT then
automatically adapts its dialogue strategies based on this dynamically
changing user model.  An empirical evaluation of the system
demonstrates the utility of the approach. In particular, by adapting
the dialogue strategies of TOOT in response to inferences regarding
repeated ASR misrecognitions, we significantly improve the task
success rate.
