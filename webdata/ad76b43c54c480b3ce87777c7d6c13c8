Project:
I found that one of the deficiencies in the existing SIS testbed
provided to us was the lack of introspection into the way that the
components interact with one another through message passing.  As it
is now, one can only see the messages as they pass through the server
and only for a very brief period of time with no way to examine which
components these messages would be sent to nor to investigate past
messages.  I plan to solve both of these issues by incorporating a
graphical way to visualize the messages flowing through the testbed as
well as allowing the user to traverse back and forth through the
history of messages.  I will do this by incorporating an open source
visualization framework called Prefuse that will allow me to build a
visualization of the testbed structure and to show message flow
through the system in an easy to view manner.  Time permitting I will
also investigate ways to save this information to be viewed later.
