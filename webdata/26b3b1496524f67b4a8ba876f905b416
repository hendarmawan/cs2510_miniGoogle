<h1>C-Gestures and Finger Gestures</h1>
</center>
<b>Basic gestures are represented by clicks, or c-gestures.
In the future, finger gestures will be used:
(1) To make a point gesture, the user moves his finger to
<a href="point1.jpg">point at a sentient map</a> and
rests his finger there for a few seconds.
(2) To make a time-line gesture, the user first points
at a sentient map, and then moves his finger to
<a href="point2.jpg"> a second point on the map</a>
and rests his finger there for a few seconds.
(3) Finally, to make an area gesture, the user first points
at a sentient map, then moves his finger to a second
point, then <a href="point3.jpg"> a third point on the map</a>,
and finally moves his finger <a href="point1.jpg">back to
the original point</a>, and rests his finger there
for a few seconds.
