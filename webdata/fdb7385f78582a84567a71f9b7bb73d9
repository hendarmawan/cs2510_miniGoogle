<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Educational applications</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Online information systems (Information 
    retrieval systems)</font></li>
  <li><em><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Personalized</font></em><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    websites (this is a growing area) (e.g. My Yahoo)</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Personalized websites typically do 
  not exibit the behavior we call an adaptive system. Typically, the user sets 
  up a profile and the system will not change it. However, competition between 
  sites, such as My Yahoo and My Excite, will continue, and progression towards 
  an adaptive system seems logical.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Adaptive Hypermedia 
  Application Model (AHAM)</strong></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">is an extension of the Dexter 
    hypermedia reference model</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">provides a foundation for developing 
    new Adaptive Hypermedia Systems</font></li

</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;<font size="3">AHAM 
  acknowledges that doing &quot;useful&quot; and &quot;usable&quot; adaptation 
  in a given application depends on three factors:</font></font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The application must 
    be based on a <em>domain model</em>, describing how the information content 
    of the application or &quot;hyper-document&quot; is structored (using concepts 
    and concept relationships).</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The system must construct 
    and maintain a fine-grained <em>user model</em> that represents a user's preferences, 
    knowledge, goals, browsing history and other relevant aspects.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The system must be able 
    to perform adaptation of the content and link structure, based on the domain 
    model and user model. In order to do so the author must provide an <em>adaptation 
    model</em> consisting of <em>adaptation rules</em>. The rules define both 
    the process of generating the adaptive presentation and that of updating the 
    user model. An AHS may offer some built-in rules for common adaptation aspects 
    and user model updates. This reduces the author&#8217;s task of providing 
    such rules. The AHS may also offer a rule language through which authors can 
    define additional rules.</font></li>
</ol>
<font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The division into a domain 
model (DM), user model (UM) and adaptation model (AM) provides a clear separation 
of concerns when developing an adaptive hypermedia application.&quot;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
