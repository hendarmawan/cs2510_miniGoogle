  Methods and techniques of 
  adaptive hypermedia
 </h2> 

 </center> 
 <div align=left><FONT size=4><STRONG><U>Adaptation 
techniques</U> refers to methods of providing adaptation in existing AH systems. 
</STRONG></FONT>     
   
 </div>
<DIV align=left>These techniques are a part of the implementation level of an AH 
system. Each technique can be characterized by a specific kind of <EM>knowledge 
representation</EM> and by a specific <EM>adaptation algorithm</EM>.</DIV>
<DIV align=left>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV align=left><STRONG><FONT size=4><U>Adaptation methods</U> are defined as 
generalizations of existing adaptation techniques.</FONT> </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV align=left>Each method is based on a clear adaptation idea which can be 
presented at the conceptual level.</DIV>
<P>The <EM>same conceptual method</EM> can be implemented 
by <EM>different techniques</EM>. At the same time, some <EM>techniques</EM> are 
used to implement <EM>several methods</EM> using the <EM>same knowledge 
representation</EM>.</P>

<IMG align=center src="fig2.jpg"></P>
<UL>
  <LI>The 1st dimension is <EM>where adaptive hypermedia systems can be 
  helpful--</EM>application areas</LI>
  <LI>The 2nd dimension is <EM>what features of the user are used as a source of 
  the adaptation--</EM>user features</LI>
  <LI>The 3rd dimension is <EM>what can be adapted by a particular 
  technique--</EM>ways to adapt hypermedia(content adaptation and link 
  adaptation)</LI>
  <LI>The 4th dimension&nbsp;is the <EM>adaptation goals</EM> achieved by 
  different methods and techniques--<EM>why</EM> these methods and techniques 
  are applied and which problems of the users they can solve--dependent on 
  application areas</LI></UL>
