<H3>Modeling Issues</H3>
<DL>
<DT>Differences between traditional data modeling and time-based data modeling:
<UL>
<LI>Data Flow
<LI>Timing
<LI>Temporal Composition
<LI>Synchronization
</UL>
</DL>
<P>
Support for a BLOB (Binary Large Object) data type has been added to most commercial database systems. Although a BLOB does allow the user to reference large data objects, a BLOB does not provide enough support for complex data types.
<P>
Key Problem: <B>The description of the structure of time-based media in a form appropriate for querying, updating, and presentation.</B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Interpretation
<DD>Traditional data modeling does not consider the interpretation of the data; mainly because the data is of a simple type.
<UL>
<LI>Heterogeneity
<UL>
<LI>Different media types may be contained within a single storage unit.
</UL>
<LI>Interleaving
<UL>
<LI>Elements of different media types may be interleaved in a single storage unit.
</UL>
<LI>Padding
<UL>
<LI>Unused (or blank) data may be added to account for differences in transfer rates.
</UL>
<LI>Out-of-order Elements
<UL>
<LI>Key elements may be placed ahead of elements that precede it in time.
</UL>
<LI>Scalability
<UL>
<LI>Only the necessary parts of the data need to be sent to the client. Example, scaling the video stream to a lower resolution before sending it.
</UL>
</UL>
<LI>Quality Factors
<UL>
<LI>The encoding scheme used determines the quality of the stored information. Some encoding schemes, such as JPEG and MPEG, are lossy.
<LI>The low level parameters should not be viewable due to the specific nature of the parameters. Only generic quality factors should be viewable.
</UL>
<LI>Timing
<UL>
<LI>There are two timing issues: real-time constraints (display or playback rates) and temporal correlations (relationships between media objects).
<LI>Real-time constraints are concerned with the sampling rates of record and playback.
<LI>Temporal correlations are concerned with the timing between media objects, such as synchronization.
</UL>
<LI>Derivation
<UL>
<LI>Derivation is the construction of a media object from another (possible more than one) media object. All that is needed to construct the derived object is the non-derived objects and various parameters needed in the transformation.
<LI>An example is a "wipe" video transition where one video scene is wiped away to reveal the following scene. The "wipe" video transition can be constructed from the first and second video sequences.
<LI>The derived object may or may not be stored in the database depending upon the available space and the resources required to construct the derived object.
</UL>
<LI>Composition
<UL>
<LI>Composition refers to the ability to combine two or more "simpler" media types to construct a more complicated media object.  This is usually in the form of spatial or temporal relationships.
