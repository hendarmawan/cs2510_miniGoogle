<h2>Software engineering can be regarded as the discipline for the
systematic specification, design, substitution and verification of
patterns.</h2>

VISUAL PATTERNS

<h2>In multimedia software engineering
the patterns are almost always visual,
or can be made highly visual,
due to the very nature of multimedia.
Visual notation can also help in detecting
and/or discovering patterns.
</h2>

<h3>Three types of patterns:
(1) Syntactic patterns,
(2) Semantic patterns, and
(3) Pragmatic patterns.

<p>
In our approach syntatic patterns are specified by
visual languages such as
IC cards, semantic patterns are specified by
active index, and pragmatic patterns are
the programs implemented using software tools.
