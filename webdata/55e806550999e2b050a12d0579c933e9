			CruiseControl is used to automate the build process.  CruiseControl
			monitors the CVS for any changes.  When a source file is changed,
			CruiseControl will automatically rebuild the project and run tests.  If
			the build or one of the tests fail, CruiseControl will notify the developer
			that made the changes since the last working build.
			<br>
			<br>
			A fully automated and reproducible build, including testing, can be very
			beneficial to the development process.  Especially if it is done several
			times a day. By continuously building and testing a project, problems
			will be known about earlier and can be fixed earlier.
			<br>
			<br>
			CruiseControl uses a "Build Loop."  The Build Loop is a daemon process which 
			will periodically check your source control tool for changes to your codebase,
			build if necessary, and send out a notification regarding the status of the build.
