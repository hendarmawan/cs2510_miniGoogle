The endorsed.zip file is now located in /home/virtualclassroom

copy these files to the $/TOMCAT_HOME/common/endorsed folder in your Tomcat
5.0.28 install

If anyone has any questions on how to get the example running please email
me back.

NOTE:  i have found that different versions of Tomcat require different sets
of files in the endorsed directory so please only use 5.0.28

I did my best to make this as simple as possible.  I'm hoping the install
instructions are portable across machines.  I know that if the example can't
find all the .jars it needs Axis will throw some strange errors.

EVERYONE: please email me when you get it running - i need feedback to see
it's working for you.

NOTE:  the CVS contains a directory with all the .jar files needed to
compile run the test client.  Make sure you setup a "runtime" classpath when
you run the sample application.  It should default to have all the .jars in
the /lib folder if it doesn't add them.

Also, you need MyEclipse configured correctly.  Please find the application
servers configuration settings through Window/Preferences then
/MyEclipse/Application Servers/Tomcat 5 configure the directory to match
your tomcat install

Make sure "Enable" is selected and deselect "enable" for JBoss3 (the
default)


To deploy just find the deploy icon on the toolbar.  Make sure you follow
the instructions to copy all the .jar files to /WEB-INF/lib (I think i
included a picture in the setup docs)

If everything is installed correctly you can find the TestMsgClient.java
file under the source in the client folder under axis.  Right click on this,
then select run.  Check the classpath settings on next dialog box and then
run.  You should get the output i have in the pic in the setup doc.

Again, please let me know if you have any problems.
