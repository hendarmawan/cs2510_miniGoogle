<h1>Exercise 1(b)</h1>

The SIS Slow Decision Network and Fast Decision Network are
each represented by a sequential Petri net.
<p>
Slow Decision Network:
The slow decision network consists of all five phases for the Slow Intelligence System, i.e., Enumerator, Propagator, Eliminator, Adaptor and Concentrator. However the five phases can be arranged in any preferred sequence.

The Petri net model is shown below:

<p>
Fast Decision Network:
The fast decision network consists of a selected number of phases, such as Enumerator, Adaptor and Concentrator.

The Petri net model is shown below:

<p>
To combine the Slow Decision Network with the Fast Decision Network to form a Slow Intelligence System, we may need a way to indicate when should the system enter the Fast Decision Cycle.  One way to do that is through the introduction of a .Panic button.: when the Panic button is pushed, the system should neter the Fast Decision Cycle.  For the Petri model, this s equivalent to placing a token in a .Panic Place.
<p>
Normally the Slow Decision Network will be run in
repetition, constituting the Slow Decision Cycles.
This is accomplished by placing tokens in the
two places marked as "Slow" and "Start".
The token in the "Slow" place will be recycled almost
immediately, whileas the token in the "Start" place will
be recycled after the Slow Decision Network is run.

<br>
When a token is inserted to the "Panic" place, its effect
is to inhibit the Slow Decision Network by removing
tokens from the "Panic" and "Slow" places and placing a token in the
"Fast" place, and then to run the Fast Decision Network
by removing tokens from the "Start" and "Fast" places,
and finally to recycle the tokens back to the "Slow" and "Start"
places after the Fast Decision Network is run.
The system is now ready to resume its normal slow decision cycles.
<br>
<br>
This solution is not perfect: when there are tokens in
the "Panic", "Slow" and "Start" places at the same time, the system
may still run the Slow Decision Network rather than inhibit it.
In fact, in the few seconds (or milliseconds) after the
panic button is hit, there may be a race condition -
the system may either react to the panic button or
continue with its normal routine.
By adding sufficient delay time to the transition for
the Slow Decision Network, the race condition can be
avoided.  In other words, even when there are tokens in
the "Panic", "Slow" and "Start" places at the same time,
the transition reacting to the panic button will always fire
first, thus successfully inhibiting the Slow Decision
Network.
