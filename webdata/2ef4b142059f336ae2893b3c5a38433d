<b>Course Description:</b>
This course is one of the <a href="../SEtrack.htm">graduate courses in software engineering</a>.
The emphasis of this course is on
modeling and design of distributed multimedia systems.
A framework is presented for data management,
multimedia information management,
knowledge management,
communications management,
activities management,
interface management and
applications to distributed systems, real-time systems, multi-media systems and
information retrieval systems design.
Based upon this framework various research topics of distributed
multimedia systems will be explored.


<p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> The student is expected to be familiar with
programming languages, formal languages theory, database theory, data structures and computer networks.
The following courses are required: CS110 (formal structures), CS155 (database) or consent of instructor.

<p>
<b>Textbook:</b>


No textbook is required.  
<br>
In lieu of the textbook, students will be asked to read selected papers in
<a href="http://www.ksi.edu/seke/dmsproc.html">the proceedings</a>
of <a href="http://www.ksi.edu/seke/dms10pgm.html">2010 Int'l Conference on Distribued Multimedia Systems</a>.
The emphasis will be on <a href="proj10/">papers related to slow intelligence systems</a>.

<p>
<b>Course structure:</b>

<p>
The first part of the course consists of the instructor's lectures to
present the elements of distributed multimedia systems, mainly based
upon the textbook and the instructor's own research.  Lecture notes will be provided on the Web
for this part of the course.  This will set the stage for the second
part of the course.  Several exercises will be assigned to motivate
the term projects.  There will be a (take-home) midterm examination.

<p>
In the second part of the course the students will study the textbook
and each student will present a paper related to a chapter of the text book.
At the same time the students will start to work on term projects
based upon the theory presented in the first part of the course.

<p>
There is no final examination.  The students will present their
term projects and turn in the term project reports.

<p>
<b>Grading:</b>
The student is expected to do four or five exercises (20%), take one midterm (30%),
give one seminar presentation related to a chapter in the textbook (10%),
make a project presentation/demonstration (10%) and turn in
the project report (30%).
The project report should be made available to the instructor and the discussant, one week prior to presentation.

<p>

<p>
<b>Term Project:</b>
Project ideas will be presented during the first part of the course.
Then a topic can be chosen based upon the student's interest.

<p>
<b>Unique Features of this course:</b>
We will use the Web extensively for this course.  The class notes for the first part of the course will be
available on the Web.  The exercises and (take-home) mid-term examination
will also be available on the Web.
Students are encouraged to turn in exercises, mid-term examination by
e-mail, make presentations by developing a Web-based visual/multimedia
presentation and give the project demo/presentation the same way.
