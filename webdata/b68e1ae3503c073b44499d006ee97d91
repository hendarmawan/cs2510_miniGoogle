<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A couple users of the system 
  have been identified. First, emergency dispatch centers are equiped with full 
  size monitors capable of displaying the most information visually to the user. 
  The dispatcher will be able to see the current mapped crossings, and color coded 
  track indications. Additionally, these users will be provided with estimated 
  delay times and estimated time until block. This type of use will usually be 
  working autonomously. Additionally, it is more likely that the computer they 
  are using has access to a high speed network connection, and therefore will 
  be provided with periodic updates in addition to on-demand updates of the system 
  state. This type of user will not want to have an audio announcement of the 
  information as they are often in communication with several individuals at one 
  time. These users can be expected to simply glance at the screen to get the 
  latest information and provide their suggested course to emergency vehicles 
  and personnel that either are not equiped with the hardware to access the system 
  or are not in a situation to use that hardware.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second type of user 
  identified is one with hardware mounted in their vehicle, such as the computers 
  mounted in police cars. The media will need to be adapted to the hardware and 
  situations that these users may find themselves. The hardware in police cars 
  would be much smaller than a normal sized computer monitor, so the graphics 
  need to be adapted for this smaller screen. The visual cues of the map would 
  be advantageous to a police officer as they could quickly assess if there is 
  a train approaching a crossing while chasing a suspect. Additionally, they will 
  be provided with numerical output of estimated delays and estimated time until 
  blocks on crossings for the situation that they have a partner with them who 
  then can navigate the driver towards an unblocked crossing. A future enhancement 
  to the system may include an audio announcement of the delays and block times 
  for crossings displayed on the map. This would enable the driver, if alone, 
  to keep his or her eye on the road rather than reading a screen. Firefighters 
  are another type of user that falls into this category. They could use this 
  system in the same manner as the police, of course their goal is a bit different. 
  Again, in this adaptation the system would periodically update in order to keep 
  the officers up to date on the status of the system.</font></p>
