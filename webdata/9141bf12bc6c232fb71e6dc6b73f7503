The purpose of this exercise is to find ways to accurately query objects
without having to use tags, just the objects themselves.  This leads to
very complex sorting and searching of a database that can be potentially
very large.  We need to pick and choose the correct "similarity" features
to accurately query these objects.  Unfourtunately, similarity
choices can change, depending on what you need from each database. Also,
with the higher number of features increasing (the dimensionality of the
vectors increasing), we have poorer results. Most of these techniques are
from the 80's, but there have been newer types of indexing that can handle
higher dimensions with greater accuracy (X trees, R* trees).
