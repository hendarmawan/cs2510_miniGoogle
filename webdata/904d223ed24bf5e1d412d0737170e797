Approaches to subjectivity and sentiment analysis often
rely on manually or automatically constructed lexicons. Most such
lexicons are compiled as lists of words, rather than word meanings
("senses").  However, many words have both subjective and objective
senses as well as senses of different polarities, which is a major
source of ambiguity in subjectivity and sentiment analysis.  The goal
of the proposed work is to address this gap, by investigating novel
methods for subjectivity sense labeling, and exploiting the results in
sense-aware subjectivity and sentiment analysis.  To achieve this
goal, we target the following four research objectives. First, we will
develop new methods for assigning subjectivity labels to word senses
in a taxonomy. Second, we will develop contextual subjectivity
disambiguation techniques that will effectively make use of the word
sense subjectivity annotations. Third, we will explore the application
of these techniques to multiple languages, including languages with
fewer resources than English. Finally, we plan to demonstrate the
usefulness of our research results through an end application for
crosscultural tracking of opinions and sentiments.
