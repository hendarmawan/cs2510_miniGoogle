<p><font color="#000000" size="4">.NET creates a new concept,
&quot;the Internet Operating System&quot;, and through web
services that leverage open standards like SOAP and the existing
network structure and security, allows cross-platform development
to an extent not before possible. .NET web services can be
integrated into existing distributed object technologies today by
replacing their RPC wire protocol with SOAP. Thus large-scale
distributed application development and deployment become
possible on a level that presents major difficulties today.
Through its CLR programming languages even become more of a non-issue.
Stricter versioning policies help to ensure greater stability
during upgrades, even in shared libraries. And this in turn gives
application developers greater freedom to create install-on-demand
products that are cheaper and more cost-efficient. &quot;Software
as a service&quot; - a subscription model for application
deployment - becomes a feasible option, opening up new business
models.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4">Microsoft has bet the farm on .NET.
This is scary for both those who like and dislike them. For those
who like it - we hope they aren't wrong. For those who dislike it
- although Microsoft has never innovated much (in fact if you
look at .NET you can find bits and pieces of it scattered
everywhere, in X-Drive, Hotmail, Java, Installshield, Jini, and
many other places), it is excellent at taking good ideas and
improving on them (witness how Microsoft Word slowly crushed
WordPerfect). A lot of the things .NET makes possible are
appealing to businesses. In typical Micrsoft fashion, they may
just have gotten wind of where trends were leading - and pulled
together all these pieces to get there first.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4">In short, Microsoft will either
fail, and for the first time ever slide from dominance in its
first ever significant bad business decision - or else will
succeed, and quite possibly...conquer the world.</font></p>
