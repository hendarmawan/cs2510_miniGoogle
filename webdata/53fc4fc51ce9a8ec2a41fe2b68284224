<title>Trends Analysis Component</title>
<h2>Trends Analysis Component</h2>

The trends analysis component is a separate component.
Most likely this component will run on a PC, so that
the voting component (that very likely resides on
the smart phone) will process the votes and then
forward the votes (as XML messages) to this trends
analysis component.  So, this requires the specification
of a new message type (to forward the votes from
voting component to the trends analysis component).
This message may contain the following information:
poster ID, voter's phone number and date.

<p>
The trend analysis component, upon receiving this
message, would analyze it and store it in a knowledge base.
You may assume to have a poster table
containing poster ID, poster type (keywords such
as multimedia, electronic games, etc.).
Therefore, the trend analysis component can store
in the knowledge base the following information:
poster type, count, year.

<p>
When the voting is done, a message is sent to the
voting component to close the vote.  The voting
component will send a message to the trends analysis
component to complete current year's statistics
and perform the prediction.

<p>
Trends analysis component can be used to predict what
percentage of voters would vote for what type of
posters, based upon previous years' trends.  The
simplest prediction is to take last year's entry
from the knowledge base.  A more sophisticated
prediction may take the most recent two/three/four
year's average, and so on.

<p>
So, you need to specify several type
of new messages, and come up with an example
(similar to the one outlined above) to describe the
scenario.
