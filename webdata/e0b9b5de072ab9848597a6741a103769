<h3>Abstract:
In this talk I will introduce the concept of slow intelligence. Not all intelligent systems have fast intelligence. There are a large number of intelligent systems, quasi-intelligent systems and semi-intelligent systems that have slow intelligence. Such slow intelligence systems are often neglected in mainstream research on intelligent systems. I will discuss the general characteristics of slow intelligence systems and then concentrate on evolutionary query processing for distributed multimedia systems, and mission control in emergency
management systems,  as two examples of artificial slow intelligence systems.
