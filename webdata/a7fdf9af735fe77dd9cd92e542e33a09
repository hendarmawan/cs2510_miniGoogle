This tutorial includes a series of interactive Adobe Captivate simulations that will help you get started with Adobe Dreamweaver CS4.
These simulate the Dreamweaver web development environment and let you participate as if you were actually using Dreamweaver.
However you must have already installed CS4 before getting on with this tutorial.

<p>
The lab computers have DreamWeaver MX 2004 pre-installed.
This is the version you will use in practicing DreamWeaver.
The newest version is DreamWeaver CS4.  If you purchase it
recently this is the version you have on your PC.  The
above mentioned tutorial is also for CS4.  However since you
are dealing with the basics, it will not make too much
difference.

familiar with the web editor and it's abilities. Have the ability to crate new 
pages very quickly. Familiar formatting methods. HTML coding is done for you!</p>

document using the html code you know and the WYSIWYG interface.</p>

website. This would allow you to manage and edit your site as one unit. </p>
