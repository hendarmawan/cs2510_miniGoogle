<h3 class="title">Academic Honesty</h3>
<!--	  <p>Do not plagiarize.&nbsp; See <a
	  href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Eciddeweb/FACULTY-DEVELOPMENT/TA_HANDBOOK/end-draft.htm">http://www.pitt.edu/~ciddeweb/FACULTY-DEVELOPMENT/TA_HANDBOOK/end-draft.htm</a> for definition and examples.  <b>Plagiarizers will fail this course and receive disciplinary actions according to university policies</b>.</p> -->
<p>All submitted work <b>must be your own work</b>.
<b>Plagiarizers will fail this course and receive
disciplinary actions according to university policies</b>.<br>
</p>
<p>You may discuss the assignments with each other;
you may also refer to printed literature and web resources for
background research. <b>However</b> you must list the names of people
with whom you have had discussions and provide proper citations to any
resources to which you referred. Failure to do so is considered
plagiarism. </p>

<h3 class="title">Absences</h3>
<p>If an absence is unavoidable, you are responsible for making
arrangements <b>to ensure that your assignments are turned in on time</b>.
You are also responsible for obtaining the materials passed out and the
information announced during the missed class. In case of extraordinary
circumstances (hospitalization, family emergency) you should contact me
as soon as possible so that we may arrange an extension for an
assignment or schedule a make-up exam <i>prior to the due date</i>.
Late assignments <b>will not</b> be accepted. No make-ups will be
given for pop-quizzes</p>

<h3 class="title">Course Grade</h3>
<p>The course grade will be decided based on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Class participation (10%) </li>
  <li> Problem Sets (20% -- 5% each) </li>
  <li> Exams (30% -- 15% each) </li>
  <li> Term Project (40%) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial Brainstorming, Project Updates, Peer Feedback (5%)</li>p
    <li>Formal Project Proposal (10%)</li>
    <li>Project Presentation (5%)</li>
    <li>Project Report (20%)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Post-lecture Notes</h3>

<p>For each lecture (starting from lecture 4), there will be two
official <i>note takers</i>. This will be rotated -- each student in
the class will be responsible for preparing the post-lecture notes for
three to four lectures. The schedule will be posted by the 2nd week of
the semester.

<p>Students who are not note-takers are encouraged to pose questions
for the note-takers (e.g., what concepts would you like to see further
explained). The note takers will have one week to prepare the
post-lecture notes. During that week, you should send me drafts of
your notes. You may discuss the lecture with the other note taker(s)
but it is not required.  Ideally, you should go over the notes with me
during my office hours before they are due.

<p>>These notes <b>should not be a transcript</b> of what is said
during class, and they <b>are not meant to be notes to
yourself</b>. The target audience of your notes are <i>other students
in the class</i>. A good set of post-lecture notes will address the
more common questions from the rest of the class; they will include
references to additional sources (either online or from the textbooks
in reserve); they may contain additional technical details that we
don't have time to cover in a 75 minute class; and they will provide
some synthesis of and insights to the major ideas discussed during the
lecture.

<p>The grades for these notes constribute to your class participation score.

<h3 class="title">Textbook</h3>
<p> This course does not require you to purchase any particular textbook, but
there are several suggested reference textbooks; I have put them on reserve at the
Hillman Library. 

<h3 class="title">Office Hours</h3>
<p>In addition to my regular office hours, you may make
appointments for further meetings; however, these appointments should be made at least a day in
advance.</p>

<h3 class="title">Class Conduct</h3>
<p>Professional behavior is expected from everyone. Please mute your
cell phone during class.&nbsp; Phone rings are disruptive to
lectures because they interrupt everyone's train of thought.

<h3 class="title">Students With Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and
Disability Resources and Services, 216 William Pitt Union, (412)
648-7890/(412) 383-7355 (TTY), as early as possible in the term. DRS
will verify your disability and determine reasonable accomodations for
this course. </p>
