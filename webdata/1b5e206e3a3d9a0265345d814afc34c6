Interactive and Incremental Development: Iterations
are fixed length, usually around two weeks each, to
maximize feedback and fixed scope to retain stability.

customer are colocated to facilitate face-to-face

Release plan/feature backlog: Desired features are defined at a high level and prioritized by customers.
<p>
Iterative plan/task backlog: High level features from the release plan are prioritized along with their implementation tasks in an iteration plan/task backlog.
<p>
Self-organizing team: Team members complete tasks collaboratively without top-down management control.
