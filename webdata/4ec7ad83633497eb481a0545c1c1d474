  <H1>HIPR2 - Software used</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>
<h4>HIPR2 is usable on unix, Windows and Macintosh. The most interesting part 
  is probably the interactive JAVA applets, requiring JAVA 2 to be installed on 
  your machine. Also, Perl is used to create the double set of hypermedia: HTML 
  and LaTeX. Overall, there is a language called HIPRscript, which includes about 
  300 source files. Although at the moment, it is impossible to install HIPR2 
  locally (according to Installation Guide below), specific instructions as to 
  how to install the software in directories is included at: </H4>

<h4>Changes may be made either by changing the HTML or LaTeX files, or by changing 
  the original HIPRScript. The second way is safer, because later conversions 
  from the HIPRScript ( to both HTML and LaTeX) would otherwise overwrite any 
  individual changes you may have made. Especially if equations and other non-ASCII 
  symbols are included, this is the best choice, because such notation is done 
  with inline graphics, which are generated by the HIPRscript translation. </H4>
