        <p><font size="4">Figure 5 shows a simplified index cell for the
        instrument manager.&nbsp; The states shown are identified as follows:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="4">State 0: Active State.&nbsp; This state is the
            initial state of the Instrument Manager instance.&nbsp; From this
            state, this manager is awaiting requests to be processed through to
            the instruments.</font></li>
          <li><font size="4">State 2: Verify Signature State. If a request for a
            signature verification has been processed, the manager will enter
            this state awaiting a return of signature information from the
            appropriate instrument instance.</font></li>
          <li><font size="4">State 3: Process Card Info State.&nbsp; When a
            request for card information (or e-cash transaction, or cybercheck
            processing, etc.) is made, the manager will send the request to the
            instrument instance and await a response in this state.</font></li>
          <li><font size="4">State 4: Protocol Preference State. The instrument
            manager will enter this state to await a return of protocol
            preferences which will be processed as required by the caller,
            normally the operations manager, which is requiring a protocol to
            process some operation.</font></li>
          <li><font size="4">State 5: Available Instruments State. If a request
            is made to determine instruments that are available, this state will
            be entered to compile the list of instruments, which will be
            returned as a result of the trasition to the Active state.&nbsp; An
            occasion for this would be similar to entering a store and having
            the clerk inform the customer that they accept VISA and personal
            checks--then the customer must open their wallet&nbsp; and determine
            which of these they currently have available.&nbsp; This process may
            also include verification of purchase limits or expiration dates.</font></li>
          <li><font size="4">State 6: Balance Return State.&nbsp; State used to
            await an instrument's reply to a balance inquiry.</font></li>
