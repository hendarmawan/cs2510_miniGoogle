<ul>
<li> Background Information
    <ul>
    <li> Relational Database Idea
    <li> Multi-Attribute Selection with Single Attribute Indices
        <ul>
        <li> We can guarantee not missing out on any object 
        </ul> 
    </ul>
<p>
<li> Example of Spatial Join: Map of countries and rivers
<p>
<li> Shape Matching Example
    <ul>
    <li> General Rectangular Shape Covers
    <li> Additive Rectangular Shape Covers
    <li> Sequential Descriptions
        <ul>
        <li> The first rectangles added are the ones that best
              show most important features
        <li> Uniqueness of each description
        </ul>
    <li> How do we store these rectangles in the database?
        <ul>
        <li> The position (x,y) of the rectangle is the center
             of it
        <li> Subsequent height and length
        </ul>
     <li> From here we can implement any type of indexing system
     <li> Examples of Matching Algorithms
         <ul>
         <li> Full Match
         <br> -has the correct shape and position
         <li> Match With Shift
         <br> -doesn't matter if the shape is shifted or not
         <li> Match With Uniform Scaling
         <br> -The actual size of the object doesn't matter
         <li> Match With Independant Scaling
         <br> -the axes can possibly have non-uniform scaling
         <br> -used when picture is taken at angle instaed of straight on
</ul>
