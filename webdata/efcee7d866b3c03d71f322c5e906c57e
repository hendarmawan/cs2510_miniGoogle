<p align="left"><b>Project Motivation:<font color="#0000FF">&nbsp; </font></b>
ASP.NET <font color="#0000FF">Web Matrix</font> Project is a fairly new tool for 
developing <font color="#0000FF">Web Applications</font> just for ASP.NET. As I 
did more research on it, I realized it has a lot of potential for a starter who 
is trying to get started into Web application development and is new to<font color="#0000FF"> 
ASP.NET</font>.&nbsp; Since I am quite new to ASP.NET, I felt I could learn a 
lot from creating an application which would also enable me to demonstrate the 
process of the <font color="#0000FF">Multimedia Software Engineering 
Methodology.</font>&nbsp; For my term project in this class, I plan to utilize 
this tool to create an <font color="#0000FF">application</font> that a user can 
log into to receive their <font color="#0000FF">daily horoscopes </font>along 
with some other added features I will discuss later.</p>





<p align="left"><b>Thoughts <font color="#0000FF">Before</font> Starting the Project:<font color="#0000FF">&nbsp;
</font></b>I feel this project is worth doing with <font color="#0000FF">Web 
Matrix </font>because it will give me a chance to learn a lot about the process 
of learning <font color="#0000FF">a new development tool</font> still in beta 
testing, applying the methods of <font color="#0000FF">designing and 
implementing</font>, and coming up with the desired product at the end. It will 
give me <font color="#0000FF">good experience</font> and it should also be quite
<font color="#0000FF">fun</font>. Whatever I have used with
<font color="#0000FF">Web Matrix </font>in the last few weeks seems to be quite 
appealing and so I would like to take this opportunity to explore it even more 
and hopefully learn something <font color="#0000FF">new</font>!</p>





<p align="left">Web Matrix makes building ASP applications <font color="#0000FF">
significantly easier</font> than other tools available.&nbsp; If you've never 
tried ASP.NET before, then I think Web Matrix is a <font color="#0000FF">good 
place to start.</font> It also generates HTML for you which is pretty useful and 
you can either directly edit the HTML code or make changes in the Design view . 
A couple of <font color="#0000FF">drag-and-drop </font>operations can create a 
simple but functional Web application. Another useful feature is that it 
contains various views of an ASP.NET Web page: <font color="#0000FF">both the 
source code and HTML, just the HTML, just the source code, and WYSIWYG Designer.
</font>So far I have a really good impression of this tool, but I will only know 
more as I start to build the following application I have in mind.<br>
