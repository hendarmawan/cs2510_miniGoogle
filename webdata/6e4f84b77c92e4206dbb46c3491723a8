The next step in creating your database is to build VIEWS.  Views are essentially queries that show, in table format, the information you have selected.<br>
So select NEW VIEW from the drop down menu.  Give it a name and owner and then select the DESIGN tab.<br>
Select the database, you should only have one choice.  Open the folders that contain your tables.<br>
Inside these tables you should see all of the attributes.<br><br>

At the bottom of this window is the section where you define what you want the view to display.<br>
To begin double click on the first attribute you want in your SELECT statement.<br>
Then go to the conditions section and type in the portion of your WHERE statement that applies to that attribute.<br><br>
Repeat for each item to be in the view.<br><br>

In this example I have selected PET_NAME and OWNER_NAME using the mouse.<br><br>
In the CONDITION column for the PET_NAME I have typed :<br>
     HOPEMAN.PETS.PET_OWNER = HOPEMAN.OWNERS.OWNER_NAME<br><br>
In the CONDITION column for OWNER_NAME I have typed:<br>
     HOPEMAN.OWNERS.CITY = 'Pittsburgh'<br><br>

This gives the view the following Select-From-Where statement:<br><br>

Select : PET_NAME, OWNER_NAME<br>
From : HOPEMAN.PETS, HOPEMAN.OWNERS<br>
WHERE :     HOPEMAN.PETS.PET_OWNER = HOPEMAN.OWNERS.OWNER_NAME AND HOPEMAN.OWNERS.CITY = 'Pittsburgh'<br><br>


Which produces the following view:<br><br>

Once you have created all of your tables and views you will need to dismount your active database,<br>
unless it was not mounted when you started Oracle8 Navigator,<br>
for the tables and views to be added to the active database folders.<br>
Then remount the database and select the view or table folders and see that your new objects have been added.<br>
