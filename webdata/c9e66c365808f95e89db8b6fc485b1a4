Myth: Testing is not important.  Anyone can do it!
<p>
Reality: Testing is very important.  Only well trained
software engineer can do it.
<p><p>
Myth: I can learn more by being a programmer!
<p>
Reality: Tester must also write programs.  Tester must
at least write the drivers and stubs so that testing
can be done.

<p><p>
Myth: We must wait until programming is done, before
testing can begin.

Reality: That will be too late.  Non-execution-based
testing can begin even before programs are written.
Unit testing can proceed before other units are written.
