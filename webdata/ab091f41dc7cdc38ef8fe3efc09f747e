<h1>Software Architecture Design Principles</h1>

<h2>
A software component infrastructure is a designed set of shared components
that supports a set of applications in a particular domain or domains,
and these applications must function within the constraints imposed by the infrastructure.
<p>
When designing the software component infrastructure, you must have a
<i>base set</i> of applications in mind.  The final application
is constructed around the software component infrastructure.
