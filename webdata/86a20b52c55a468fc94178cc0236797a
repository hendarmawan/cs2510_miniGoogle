      <td width="60%" height="21"><font size="4">1.&nbsp; The destination of a
        message must be dynamic--and does not fall into the specific categories
        of Broadcast, Contend, Send to Specific IC, etc.&nbsp; The difficulty
        here is that in some instances, it is not sufficient for example,&nbsp;
        to allow <b>any</b> Visa Instrument to receive a payment message.&nbsp;
        Such a message must be sent to a specific IC, but one that is determined
        during execution, not as part of the model.</font>
        <p><font size="4">2.&nbsp; Caller/Recipient Model.&nbsp; Difficulty
        arises when an IC must respond to a specific message from another
        IC.&nbsp; Although this can be accomplished (as shown) by adding states
        which cause an IC to await a response message, this is still a tenuous
        relationship.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">3. Extending the design might also include the ability
        to &quot;reuse&quot; transitions.&nbsp; This could merely be a function
        of the IC Builder.&nbsp; As described in the model of the G-Net, there
        may be a hierarchical nature to the IC design, where a particular
        &quot;subroutine&quot; should be reused.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">4. The final recommendation is that of code reuse and
        compatibility.&nbsp; As stated earlier, the e-wallet is best coded in
        Java due to the platform independent nature. Using Java ensure that all
        wallets are compatible and provide equal functionality.&nbsp;
        Additionally, if the system is implemented in Java, an additional
        recommendation would be to create a conformance to the JavaBean model.</font></p>
