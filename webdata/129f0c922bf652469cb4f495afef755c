<ol>&nbsp;
<br>EAI (enterprise application integration) is a business computing term
for the plans, methods, and tools aimed at modernizing, consolidating,
and coordinating the computer applications in an enterprise. Typically,
an enterprise has existing legacy applications and databases and wants
to continue to use them while adding or migrating to a new set of applications
that exploit the Internet, e-commerce, extranet, and other new technologies.
EAI may involve developing a new total view of an enterprise's business
and its applications, seeing how existing applications fit into the new
view, and then devising ways to efficiently reuse what already exists while
adding new applications.</ol>
