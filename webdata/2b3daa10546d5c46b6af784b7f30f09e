<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My project is to develop 
  a rail traffic notification system for use by emergency personnel. I have reviewed 
  the Adaptive Hypermedia Application Model (AHAM) which can be used for conceptual 
  development of an Adaptive Hypermedia Application (AHA). This report will discuss 
  the background and features of the Adaptive Hypermedia Application Model. The 
  three phase MSE methodology of Requirements Specification in terms of IC cards, 
  Relational Graph, and IC Structure learned in class was applied. This report 
  will go through each of these steps, and will then show the development of the 
  system using AHAM. The report will also provide an overview of the project, 
  and will provide some insight to why this project should be supported. Finally, 
  the report will discuss the design details, application and usage of the project.</font>

<p> <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For my project, I proposed 
  a grade level rail traffic notification system. The idea here is to provide 
  positioning information to emergency personnel for trains that may be passing 
  through their town. This information can be used by police, ambulances, fire 
  trucks, and any other emergency personnel that may need to use grade level railroad 
  crossings.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This project is important 
  because small towns all across the country that are located by railroads. However 
  since they are small, and there often isn't much traffic, many grade level railroad 
  crossings do not warrant local governments to install (nor do they often have 
  enough money even if they did want to install) a bridge over railroad track(s). 
  In many cases towns were settled because of the railroad, but have now spread 
  to either side of the railroad tracks. This results in cases where an emergency 
  occurs on one side of the tracks, but the emergency personnel and equipment 
  are located on the other side. As you may be aware, the length of trains can 
  be quite large, so finding a passable crossing can be the difference between 
  life and death. By providing information about blocked crossings due to rail 
  traffic, emergency personnel can minimize any delay cause by the traffic blockage.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The general idea is to provide 
  the information indicating passable crossings, maybe by map (visual), audio, 
  or text. The system will request the type of device needing the information 
  and the system will provide adaptive media to that device. If a dispatch system 
  is a 8-9 inch display mounted in a police car, it may be able to display a small 
  map. If it is a dispatcher on a PC a large map, possibly with more detail can 
  be provided, and finally if it is a cell phone or PDA carried by medical personnel, 
  they can see text indications of unblocked crossings.</font></p>
