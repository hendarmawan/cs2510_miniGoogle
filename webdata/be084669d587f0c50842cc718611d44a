Abstract:
I will talk about our IS
organization as a prelude to my presentation.  I plan to talk about the
reality of software engineering in a company, viewing it from a software
development lifecycle perspective; from requirement inception through to
production implementation.  I will speak to the methodology's and tools we
use to facilitate our lifecycle.  My hope is to provide a perspective on
how software engineering is actually put into use to create business value
based on business requirements, which is the reason we do software
engineering in the end.
