<h2>Course Description</h2>

<p>Networked systems are becoming an increasingly prevalent and, in
some cases, intrusive features in our everyday lives.  Examples
include online social networks, medical information systems,
distributed sensor networks, and context aware applications.  While
these systems certainly provide users with many direct and indirect
benefits, they also expose potentially sensitive personal and
corporate data to risks such as unauthorized disclosure or unintended
use (e.g., profiling).</p>

<p>This seminar course will cover recent research that aims to support
the utility of the above types of systems, while still preserving data
confidentiality and respecting user privacy.  Specific topics will be
selected from areas including flexible user authorization techniques
designed for the above types of open networked systems; the
enforcement of obligations on data retention and release; microdata
publishing, private database management, and private data mining;
pervasive monitoring technologies, such as location-based systems and
RFID; and access control and privacy policy specification, management,
and enforcement.  Student grades will be based upon paper reviews,
in-class presentations, and an individual or group research project
building upon the themes discussed in this course.</p>

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Graduate standing. </p>

<p><b>Grading:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>20% Paper reviews <a href="./review.txt">[ Review form ]</a></li>
  <li>25% Paper presentations</li>
  <li>45% Project</li>
  <li>10% Subjective</li>
