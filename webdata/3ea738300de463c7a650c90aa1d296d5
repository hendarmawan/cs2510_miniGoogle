<h3>
<font color="red">Test automation is the process of writing a computer program to do testing that would otherwise need to be done manually. </font>
<p>Although manual tests may find many defects in a software application, it is a laborious and time consuming process. In addition, it may not be effective in finding certain classes of defects. 
<p>
<font color="red">Once tests have been automated, they can be run quickly and repeatedly.</font> This is often the most cost effective method for software products that have a long maintenance life, because even minor patches over the lifetime of the application can cause features to break which were working at an earlier point in time.</p>
