   <h1>Why use XML at all when JSP can be used?</h1>
   <br>
</center> 
<font size=4>
<ul>
   <li>XML was designed to describe and store data, not to display
       it.</li>
   <li>In order to display data, an XSL program must be run on an XML
       document to transform the data into HTML code (or mostly any other
       language).</li>
   <li>So, by using an XML document in accordance with JSP pages, another 
       level of abstraction is created, leading to a program with a more
       component-base design. This can make web-based applications
faster and easier to develop.</li>
   <ul>
      <li>XML can represent the data.</li>
      <li>XSL can represent the presentation logic.</li>
      <li>JSP can represent the business logic.</li>
   </ul>
</ul>
