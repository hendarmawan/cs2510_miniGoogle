<LI> <font color="red">A <b>pattern language</b> defines a collection of patterns 
and the rules to combine them into an architectural style. Pattern 
languages describe software frameworks or families of related systems.   
[Cope]</font><br><br>
<LI> A <b>pattern language</b> is a structured collection of patterns that build 
on each other to transform needs and constraints into an architecture. 
[Cope]<br><br>
<LI> If a <b>pattern</b> is a recurring solution to a problem in a context given 
by some forces, then a <b>pattern language</b> is a collective of such solutions 
which, at every level of scale, work together to resolve a complex problem 
into an orderly solution according to a pre-defined 
goal.[community]<br><br>
<LI> Good <b>pattern languages</b> guide the designer toward useful architectures and away from architectures whose literary analogies 
are gibberish or 
unartful writing. Good architectures are durable, functional, and aesthetically pleasing, and a good combination of patterns can balance the 
forces on a system to strive towards these three goals. A good pattern language gives designers freedom to express themselves and to tailor the 
solution to the particular needs of the context where the patterns are 
applied. [Cope]<br><br> 
<LI> In the case of natural languages, the <b>pattern language</b> is generative. It not only tells us the rules of arrangement, but 
shows us 
how to construct arrangements -- as many as we want -- which satisfy the 
rules [Alexander]<br><br> 
<LI> A <b>pattern language </b>gives each person who uses it, the power to create an infinite variety of new and unique buildings, just 
as his ordinary 
language gives him the power to create an infinite variety of 
sentences.[Alexander] <br><br>
<LI> A <b>pattern language </b>forms a gestalt in which each of its patterns 
collaborate to solve a more fundamental problem that is not explicitly 
addressed by any individual pattern.[Alexander]<br><br>
