<p><font color="#000000" size="4">Since components can be
downloaded, .NET has to provide a secure runtime environment.
Assembly manifests can specify permissions they require,
permissions they would like to have, and permissions they will
never ask for. Thus, .NET can make intelligent decisions (based
on where the assembly came from, digital signatures, the
permissions its manifest claims and those it actually asks for)
as to how much security clearance to grant it, if any. And the
assembly is capable, based on how much .NET is willing to grant
it, to decide whether it should attempt to run or not. Its
security model is fine-grained and evidence-based, not just on/off.</font></p>
