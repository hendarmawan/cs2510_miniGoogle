<b>Course Description:</b>
This course is one of the <a href="../SEtrack.htm">graduate courses in software engineering</a>.
The course concentrates on the investigation of
the dual role of multimedia software engineering to
apply software engineering principles to the
design of multimedia systems, and
to apply multimedia technologies to the
practice of software engineering.
Consideration of such issues leads to
<font color=red>environment-aware software engineering (EASE)</font> and related
research topics such as <font color="red">slow intelligence systems</font>.


<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> CS1530/1631 or understanding of general principles
of software engineering; C/C++ programming; Web programming.

<p><b>Textbook:</b> The instructor is working on revising his textbook on
multimedia software engineering.  The current version can be found
<a href="bookpdf/c01.pdf">bookpdf/c01.pdf</a> through
<a href="bookpdf/c12.pdf">bookpdf/c12.pdf</a>.
(The chapters are c01, c02, ..., to c12)

<p><b>Course Structure:</b>
<p>
<b>(Part I) (First eight weeks)</b>
The instructor will present a framework of
multimedia software engineering.
Four exercises (32%)
will be given.   <!-- The first exercise is on paper only and sometimes it is a mini-essay (exercises change from year to year).
The second and third exercises are programming exercises that require
the use of c/c++/Java, TAOML, IC_compiler, IC_manager, etc. developed
by the instructor's research group, constituting the components of MICE
(multimedia information custom engineering) environment. -->

<p>
<b>Quiz and Midterm Exam:</b>
The quiz (5%) and  midterm exam (20%) cover the essence of the theory, as well as
relevant aspects of the experimental environment.
Please read <a href="../153/policy.html">grading policy</a>
for exams, projects and assignments.

<p>
<!--
<b>Grades:</b> Please find out your grades from the
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/231/grade/grade.html">
grade report system</a>.  You need to get the password from
the instructor.
-->

<p>
<b>(Part II) (Second four weeks)</b>
In the introduction to Part I
the instructor has presented a general survey on
the current research in multimedia software engineering.
Each student will then study one or several related papers to
present one aspect of multimedia software engineering in class (10%).
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/231/y13/paper13.htm">
Some topics will be suggested by the instructor</a>
and some found by the students themselves.
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/231/y11/paper11.htm">
You can also study topics studied in previous years but you need to find related new papers</a>.
The presentation is intended to stimulate discussions and
will lead to a project formulation assignment (8%)
designed to motivate the students
to explore various issues in multimedia software engineering.
Sometimes this is replaced by two project milestones (4% each).

<p>
<b>(Part III) (Final two weeks)</b>
Each student will do a term project (25%).
In lieu of classroom lectures sometimes
there will be one-on-one discussions on projects,
or small-group teleconferences
provided that our teleconferencing system is working by that time.
Individual meetings, teleconferences and classroom lectures
will be scheduled by e-mail.
<p>
Project may utilize the Kinect interface. An <a href="../153/kinectIntro.html#intro">introduction for Kinect interface</a> has been prepared to facilitate your project.
A <a href="../153/kinectIntro.html#advanced">more advanced tutorial</a> can serve as a follow-up.
Furthermore, an <a href="../153/kinectIntro.html#addon">add-on Kinect interface</a> can augment the usual web interface.

<p><b>On-line interactions:</b>
In addition to classroom lectures, this course will emphasize
on-line interactions.  In fact, the instructor hopes to offer
this course (and other courses) by distance learning in the
future.  Therefore, on-line interactions will be an important,
necessary component of this course.  The course materials,
announcements and exercises will all  be available from the
Internet.  Impromptu meetings and schedule changes will be
announced by e-mail.  <!-- Therefore, the first thing a student
should do is to send e-mail address to the instructor
in the following format: (CS2310, first-name, last-name, e-mail, grad/under).
For example, (CS2310, John, Doe, jdoe@cs.pitt.edu, grad).
<b>It is important you identify whether you are graduate or
undergraduate student.  For undergraduate students, the
reading assignment and project will be less theoretical
and more practical, unless a student chooses to do the
more theoretical assignment/project.</b>

<h1>Part II: <a href="mse/t1.htm">Survey</a> of current research</h1>
<h2>Weeks 9 to 13</h2>
Each student will study one topic and
give a presentation (see <a href="guide.html">class presentation guidelines</a>) and critical evaluation of the papers
assigned by the instructor and/or found by the student <b>(10%)</b>.
If a selected paper is available in electronic form, a link will be
made to that file -- usually in pdf format, so an Acrobat Reader should
first be downloaded.  Some of the papers can be obtained from the
instructor in hard copy (hc).  The remaining papers are available from
