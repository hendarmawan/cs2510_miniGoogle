<p><b><font size=+1>CORBA</font></b>
<blockquote>Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is an architecture
and specification for creating, distributing, and managing distributed
program objects in a network. It allows programs at different locations
and developed by different vendors to communicate in a network through
an "interface broker." CORBA was developed by a consortium of vendors through
the Object Management Group (OMG), which currently includes over 500 member
companies.</blockquote>
<b><font size=+1>Enterprise Java Beans</font></b>
<blockquote>Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) is an architecture for setting up
program component, written in the Java programming language, that run in
the server parts of a computer network that uses the client/server model.
Enterprise JavaBeans is built on the JavaBeans technology for distributing
program components (which are called Bean, using the coffee metaphor) to
client in a network.</blockquote>
<b><font size=+1>COM+</font></b>
<blockquote>COM+ is an extension of Component Object Model (COM), Microsoft's
strategic building block approach for developing application programs.
COM+ is both an object-oriented programming architecture and a set of operating
system services. It adds to COM a new set of system services for application
components while they are running, such as notifying them of significant
events or ensuring they are authorized to run.</blockquote>
<b>COM+ is viewed as Microsoft's answer to the Sun Microsystems-IBM-Oracle
approach known as Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB).</b>
<br><b>CORBA and Microsoft have agreed on a gateway approach so that a
client object developed with the Component Object Model will be able to
communicate with a CORBA server (and vice versa).</b>
