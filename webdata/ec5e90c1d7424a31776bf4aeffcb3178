<LI><H2>hypermedia- is a way to create explicit relations among pieces of
information. These relations already exist and they are emplicit. For

<LI><H2>hypermedia model- represents the interactive aspects of familiar
communication media. Examples are a news story and a book.<p></h2><ul>
News story:  user see a news caster, then a news clip, more dynamic, yet
no user interactions. User cannot make choices. For example, when to
see the news clip.<p>
Book: reader can take notes. Sections of the text can be marked as
relevant, reader's opinion can be attached as notes. Future readers can
see the notes later. This is more static and highly interactive with the
user(reader).</ul>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>We need to preserve these relations in a on-line, interactive
presentation. In addition, we want to be able to express the relations and
to
enable info to be captured for later use.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>For that an information model is needed that
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>formally define the structure of information
<LI>efficiently map the structure to storage
<LI>support information and retrieval and 
<LI>transport presentation from one platform to another</UL></UL></P>
