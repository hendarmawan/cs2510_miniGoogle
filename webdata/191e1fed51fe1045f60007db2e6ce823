<H1>CS 1550 : Handing in Assignments
</CENTER></H1>
<HR>
<BR>
Please follow the following procedure while handing in your assignments
<ul>

<li>one time, in your account, run the following commands, which will
set up your submission directory, create subdirectories assign1,
assign2 and so forth, and give the T/A permission to access these
submission directories: 
<ol>
<li>cd
<li>~jalst114/public/1550/1550-permissions.sh
</ol>
<br>
<li>You must submit your programs on your primary CSSD unix accounts.
Send us an email containing the following details BEFORE the due date (this
needs to be done for every assignment).
<ol>
<br>
<li>Name:
<br>
<li>Username: (This is your primary CSSD unix account).
<br>
<li>Submission directory:
<br>
<li>Class: (<b>MW</b> or <b>TH</b>).
</ol>
<br>
<li>Open a <b>public/cs1550-submit/assign(1 or 2..) </b> directory in your CSSD login and move 
all the files that you have to submit into that directory. You can do this 
using the 'mv' command to move the files, or 'cp' to copy them.

<br> <br>
<li> Always include a README file describing what you have done, how
to run your code, problems you encountered, etc.
<br> <br>
<!--<li>In case you have to create a symbolic link called <b>code</b> to your
local copy of nachos, that can be done using the following command:
<ol>
<br>
<li>ln -s <<b>directory where your copy of nachos is</b>> code
</ol>
<br>-->
<li>Make sure that once you have submitted the assignments, you do not
modify the files as that will change the time stamp on the file and
your assignment could be deemed as late (a 10% of the total possible
points per-day late penalty is assessed; e.g., if you hand your
assignment 45 hours late, your maximum grade will be 80/100).
<br><br>
<li>The timestamp of the file can be checked using the <b>ls -l</b> command.
</ul>
