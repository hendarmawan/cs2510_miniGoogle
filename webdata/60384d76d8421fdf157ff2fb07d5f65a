services and assembly version provide it with a great deal of
power to offer many useful services and benefits to both
developers and businesses.</font></p>

            <li><font color="#000000" size="4">&quot;Software as
                a service&quot; - strides taken against DLL Hell
                make their major contribution here</font></li>
            <li><font color="#000000" size="4">Integrating useful
                functionality derived from other businesses that
                specialize in it</font><ul>
                    <li><font color="#000000" size="4">Example: a
                        telecommunications company provides voice-mail/caller
                        ID data as a web service. This is then
                        used by the telecom's own Instant
                        Messenger software...and then your e-mail
                        client's company decides to use it as
                        well, and other application developers
                        have it available as well</font></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><font color="#000000" size="4">IT services may
                tap into vendor web services to tap their
                expertise or to outsource various services - thus
                reducing costs and at the same time extending
                their own capabilites for their customers</font></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="4">User-friendly and
        personalized Internet</font><ul>
            <li><font size="4">Intelligent devices remember your
                user preferences and can deliver your data to any
                device you are using</font></li>
            <li><font color="#000000" size="4">Computers become
                easier to use and more functional, by eliminating
                artificial constraints imposed by hardware</font></li>
            <li><font color="#000000" size="4">User data lives on
                the Internet, and may be accessed from any
                desktop, laptop, or PDA, and integrated across
                multiple applications (another XML benefit)</font></li>
