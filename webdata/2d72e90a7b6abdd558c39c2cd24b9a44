  <H1>HIPR2 - Index and Scripting</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>
<h4>Since HIPR2 is NOTimmediately available, it is very similar to HTML and other 
  languages, and there is a good reference manual:</H4>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <h4><a href="http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/HIPR2/chngehip.htm#'The">HIPR Reference Manual</a></H4>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>the details will be left to descriptions of future versions. </H4>
<h4>However, it should be mentioned that indexes can be created with HIPR2. This 
  can be done by running the HIPRscript files that create both the HTML and LaTeX 
  versions of the webpage being created: <a href="http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/HIPR2/chngehip.htm#'Making'">Index</a></H4>
<h4>The index tags look like this:</H4>
<h4> \index {ENTRY 1} {ENTRY 2}...{TEXT}</H4>
<h4>Each ENTRY creates the names of topic entries in the index. There may be up 
  to three levels of nesting. For example, the subtopic Canny, under Edge Detectors, 
  would look like this:</H4>
<h4>{Edge detectors|Canny} </H4>
<h4>with the | pipe symbols showing where subdirectories are. More than one ENTRY 
  symbol may point to the same text, but must always be a unique name.</H4>
<h4>Whenever a HIPRscript file is processed, all the index entry information in 
  that file is written into an IDX file in an index sub-directory. To generate 
  an index, one must scan this sub-directory, collate all the information in all 
  the IDX files there, and then use this information to produce the index pages. 
  The index becomes another HIPRscript file. The scanning and analysis of the 
  IDX files are performed by a Perl program. Finally, the index file itself is 
  processed by HIPRscript, creating HTML and LaTeX index pages.</H4>
