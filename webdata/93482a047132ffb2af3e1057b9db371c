<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<ul>
This course introduces the students to the research being conducted in
the Computer Science Department.  The course consists of a number of modules,
each spanning two classes and covering an active,
state-of-the-art, research topic.
All first year Ph.D. students are required to take this course, which is
open to all Computer Science graduate students.
</ul>

<h3>Requirements and grading:</h3>
<ul>
The students will be graded in each module independently
based on tests and/or homeworks or projects. 
Ninety percent of the final grade of a student will
depend on his/her grades in all the modules. The remaining ten
percent of the grade will be based on an oral presentation
that each student will make to the class on a particular research
topic.
