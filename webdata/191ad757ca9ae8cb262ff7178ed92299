<h1>Stepwise Refinement</h1>



<b>Miller's Law: At any time a human being can concentrate on 7 +- 2 chunks
(quota of information)</b>.

(Notice Clinton is more conservative than Miller)

Stepwise refinement enables the software engineer to concentrate
on those "chunks" that are the most relevant at the current phase
of development.
In other words, concentrate on most relevant aspects and ignore details.

<p>
Stepwise refinement was first introduced by Wirth in 1971, applying it to
pseudo-code.  It can also be applied to flowchart, block diagrams,
formal specifications and used in every phase of software development.

<p>
You can make mistakes in stepwise refinement.  Therefore, you need to
check each successive refinement before proceeding to the next level.
