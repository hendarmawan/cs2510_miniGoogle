<h2>Tour of Great Britain, July, 2003</h2>
<b>
I was invited to be a resident writer in the International
Translators' Summer Workshop held in <a h ref="../art03/art0720.htm">Cambridge</a>, England and
as "exercises" my scifi short stories were translated into English, Spanish and
Italian. Afterwards I rented a car and visited several <a h ref="../art03/art0721.htm">British shrines</a>.
All photos were taken using an inexpensive disposable camera, but they came out nicely.

I stayed in one of Cambridge University's colleges - Girton.  This
College is just like Harry Potter's school, with an important
difference:  all the portraits in the big dining hall are portraits
of stern looking women, because Girton used to be a women's college.
