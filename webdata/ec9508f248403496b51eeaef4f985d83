<h3>
(b) Two I-cards are consisitent if the super-components
in the overlapped sub-nets of the corresponding C-cards are identical.

<p>
(c) Two C-cards are connected if they have overlapped
sub-nets.
The C-cards can be integrated if there exists
a path between any two C-cards, i.e., they are all connected.

<p>
A collection of cards can be integrated if 
conditions (a), (b) and (c) hold for any two cards.

Term Project Topic:
The above definitions can be
refined so that they are mathematically precise.
You can then implement a consistency checker based
upon these precise definitions,
and apply your consistency checker on an
example such as the Product & Servicer Customization
System presented in previous slides.
This topic is for those who are mathematically inclined.
<p>
The following are
<a href="C-Cards.htm">four examples</a> of
C-Cards specified as pnml documents.
