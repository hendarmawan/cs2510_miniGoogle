   <h1>Image Search Engine???</h1>

<b>Scenario 1:</b> You are doing a report on Galileo and you find that a
picture of him would complement your research perfectly. You have seen
many pictures of him on the web before, but only in documents concerning
him. Wouldn't a large collection of pictures of Galileo be ideal to
choose the perfect one?
<br>
<br>
<b>Scenario 2:</b> You are looking for pictures of family or friends on
the web. How would you even attempt to find a picture of such where there
could only be a few locations where this picture is located?

<br><br>
An image search engine allows you to search for online images of specified
content by returning just the image found (along with a variety of other
information).
