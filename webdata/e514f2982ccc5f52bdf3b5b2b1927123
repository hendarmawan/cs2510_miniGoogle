PROFESSOR: THIS LECTURE HAS THREE PARTS AND THIS IS FIRST PART. THE ENTIRE LECTURE IS IN THIS FILE.




PROFESSOR: LET'S START WITH LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF
CONCEPTUAL DATABASE DESIGN.  NOW, LIKE I
MENTIONED, YOUR FIRST EXERCISE WILL BE DUE SOON.
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO GET INTO
THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND
NEXT TIME WE ARE GOING TO DETAILS OF THE ER
MODEL SO YOU CAN START WORKING ON YOUR FIRST
EXERCISE NEXT WEEKEND.
     SO AS I MENTIONED, WE NEED TO DO FOR A
PARTICULAR ENTER PRICE IS TO CAPTURE THE ENTER
PRICE INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS.  FROM THAT
REQUIREMENTS, WE COME UP WITH CONCEPTUAL
DESIGN THEN WE MAP THAT CONCEPTUAL DESIGN INTO
THE DATABASE SCHEMA THEN WE IMPLEMENT THAT
USING A COMMERCIAL AVAILABLE DATABASE SYSTEM.
OKAY?
     IF YOU CAN DO THAT, YOU ARE IN BUSINESS.
WE CAN CONFIDENTLY WORK INTO ANY COMPANY AND
HELP THEM OUT IN DESIGNING THEIR INFORMATION
SYSTEM.
     THIS IS WHAT THIS PICTURE IS SUPPOSED TO
SHOW.  OKAY?  STARTING FROM THE TOP.  THIS IS
WHERE THE ENTER PRICE IS ABOUT.  SO, IT COULD
BE A HOSPITAL, IT COULD BE A SCHOOL, IT COULD
BE A BICYCLE SHOP, WHATEVER, THAT'S WHY WE USE
THE WORD MINI WORLD.  NOT MINI ME.  HAVE YOU
SEEN THAT MOVIE?  THAT'S MY FAVORITE MOVIE.
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.  MINI ME.  THAT'S REALLY
GOOD.  SO THE MINI WORD IS THE WORD THAT
CAPTURES ALL OF THE INFORMATION IS THAT
RELEVANT TO THAT PARTICULAR ENTER PRICE.  SO
IF IT IS A BICYCLE SHOP WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
THE ITEMS THAT ARE OF IMPORTANCE TO BICYCLE
SHOP.  IF IT'S A HOSPITAL IT'S MORE
COMPLICATED.
     SO FIRST THING THAT DBA IS TO DO IS TO BE
ABLE TO COLLECT THE REQUIREMENTS, WHAT
REQUIREMENTS?  THE REQUIREMENTS CAN BE
REGARDED AS A MORE FORMAL SPECIFICATION OF THE
INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE USER.  SO IF IT IS A
BICYCLE SHOP, SO WHAT THE BICYCLE SHOP IS
CONCERNED ABOUT IS -- MAY BE IS SETTING OF --
SELLING OF ITEMS LIKE BICYCLE AND ALL OF THE
ACCESS OTHERS TO THE BIKE.  AND THEIR PRICE,
QUANTITY AND STUFF LIKE THAT.  THIS IS THE
KIND OF THING THAT THE BICYCLE SHOP MAY BE
DEAL WITH.  BUT MAYBE MORE.  SO ONLY THE USER
KNOW.  SO THE USER HAVE TO TELL US ABOUT HIS
BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS.  SO WE COLLECT
REQUIREMENTS, WE ANALYZE THAT SO THAT WE CAN
COME UP WITH THE DETAILED DATABASE
REQUIREMENTS USING THOSE REQUIREMENTS WE CAN
DO THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN.  SO THE END RESULT
OF CONCEPTUAL DESIGN IS THIS SO-CALLED
CONCEPTUAL SCHEMA.  SO THE ER DIAGRAM THAT YOU
WILL LEARN PRETTY SOON IS TO -- IS THE TOOL
THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE TO CARRY OUT THIS
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND THE PURPOSE OF YOUR
FIRST EXERCISE IS FOR YOU TO DO THIS, OKAY?
STARTING FROM USER REQUIREMENTS, WE ANALYZE
THE REQUIREMENTS, USING THE ER DIAGRAM AS A
TOOL SO WE WILL COME UP WITH THE CONCEPTUAL
DESIGN.  UP TO THAT, EVERYTHING IS ON PAPER.
OKAY?  NOTHING IMPLEMENTED.  BUT ONCE WE HAVE
DONE THAT, WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE BECAUSE
WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO TELL THE DATABASE
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  SO IF YOU GIVE ME SOME
KIND OF DATABASE DEFINITION LANGUAGE, THE DDL,
THEN I CAN TELL THE DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
WHAT SCHEMA SHOULD BE SUPPORTED.  OKAY.  SO,
YOU CAN SEE THAT ABOVE IS DBMS INDEPENDENT,
MEANING THAT IT DOESN'T DEPEND WHICH DBMS,
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DBMS WE CHOOSE, YOU
SHOULD CARRY THAT OUT.
     WHAT'S BELOW THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT
INDEPENDENT OF THE PARTICULAR DBMS YOU
SELECTED.  SO IF YOU DO OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN
AND CHOOSE RELATIONAL MODEL OR -- WHAT HAPPEN
NEXT WILL BE DIFFERENT.  THIS IS WHERE YOU
DEFINE THE SCHEMA, THEY CARRY OUT PHYSICAL
DESIGN AND THEN THE DESIGN ACTUAL DATABASE
SYSTEM.  OKAY?  SO WE ARE FIRST DO THAT AND
THIS IS COUPLED WITH YOUR FIRST EXERCISE.
ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THAT, SECOND EXERCISE IS
THIS.  OF COURSE, ALL CONSIDERABLY SIMPLIFIED
SO YOU CAN DO THAT IN A FEW HOURS.
     OKAY?  SO NOW LET'S START WITH A VERY
SIMPLE EXAMPLE.  I TALK ABOUT USER
REQUIREMENTS.  SO IF YOU ARE DATABASE
SPECIALIST OR INFORMATION ANALYST OR DBA,
DIFFERENT COMPANIES CALL IT DIFFERENTLY, YOU
WILL BET PERSON WHO WILL BE INTERVIEWING THE
CLIENT TO COLLECT USER REQUIREMENTS.  WHAT
REQUIREMENTS?  OF COURSE, WE ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS.  WHAT MAKES
THE BUSINESS CLICK?  IS THE -- IT'S THE
INFORMATION.  INFORMATION IS THE DRIVING FORCE
BEHIND MOST MODERN BUSINESSES.  NOW OF COURSE
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SO-CALLED KNOWLEDGE
BUSINESS, WHAT DRIVES THE BUSINESS IS NOT JUST
INFORMATION, IT'S KNOWLEDGE, OKAY, THAT'S THE
NEXT LEVEL.  BUT LET'S START FROM THE
INFORMATION LEVEL.  OKAY.  SO HERE WE HAVE A
HYPOTHETICAL COMPANY.  AND THIS IS VERY SIMPLE
CASE, OKAY.  SO, YOU CAN SEE THAT ALL OF THE
REQUIREMENTS WILL FIT ONE PAGE.  SO, YOU ARE
SUPPOSED TO DESIGN THE INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR
THIS COMPANY.  YOU TALK TO THE COMPANY'S
PEOPLE AND YOU GATHER THE FOLLOWING
INFORMATION.  NUMBER ONE, THE COMPANY HAS A
NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS.  MAYBE AN ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT, A PURCHASING DEPARTMENT, WHATNOT.
     EACH DEPARTMENT HAS A DEPARTMENT NAME,
LIKE ENGINEERING, USUALLY SOME CODE, SOME
NUMBER TO REFER TO THE DEPARTMENT AND SOME
MANAGER WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS DEPARTMENT.
THE MANAGER HIMSELF IS THE EMPLOYEE OF THIS
COMPANY THE MANAGER HAS A STARTING DATE TO
WORK FOR THIS COMPANY.  AND THE DEPARTMENT CAN
BE SPREAD OUT SO THE SAME ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT, MAYBE A PART IS IN SWISSVALE, A
PART IN ANOTHER LOCATION.  THAT'S NORMAL.
     WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THERE MAY BE
SEVERAL PROJECTS.  EACH PROJECT HAS A PROJECT
NAME AND IDENTIFICATION NUMBER, PROJECT MAY
ALSO BE LOCATED DIFFERENT PLACES.  AND
EMPLOYEE HAS A NAME, A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
WHICH IS ALSO A WAY WE IDENTIFY THAT PERSON,
ADDRESS, SALARY, GENDER AND BIRTHDATE.
     OKAY.  EACH EMPLOYEE IS A -- IS IN ONE
DEPARTMENT BUT MAY WORK ON SEVERAL PROJECTS.
THIS TRUE IF YOU HAVE SMALL COMPANIES.  EVERY
PERSON MUST WEAR MANY DIFFERENT HATS.
     WE HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF
HOURS EACH EMPLOYEE WORKS AT DIFFERENT
PROJECTS.  THIS WILL COME FROM THE CLIENT.
EMPLOYEE HAS A SUPER VISOR AND FINALLY FOR
INSURANCE PURPOSE, EMPLOYEE HAS DEPENDENTS AND
DEPENDENTS HAS NAME, SEX, BIRTHDATE AND OF
COURSE RELATIONSHIP TO EMPLOYEE.
     AND OF COURSE ALSO THE SPOUSE.  YOU KNOW
THE BIG NEWS YESTERDAY?  I'M SURE AWARE, CMU
APPROVED THE SAME SEX INSURANCE COVERAGE AND
PITT HAS NOT.  WE ARE BEHIND THE TIMES.
ANYONE HERE IN THE PROTEST?  NOT HERE.  OKAY.
BUT THE CMU BOARD OF TRUSTEES, CMU ALWAYS DOES
THINGS QUIETLY, THE TRUSTEES APPROVED SAME SEX
MARRIAGE.  THAT COVERS NOT JUST SAME SEX
MARRIAGE, ALSO MARRIED, AS LONG AS YOU CAN
PROVE YOU HAVE A SUSTAINING RELATIONSHIP MORE
THAN ONE YEAR AND I LIKE THE TERM, FINANCIAL
ENTANGLEMENT.  IF YOU HAVE FINANCIAL
ENTANGLEMENT.  IN OTHER WORDS YOU FIGHT ABOUT
MONEY.  THEN YOU ARE CONSIDERED A COUPLE.  AND
THEN YOU GET INSURANCE BENEFITS.  I LIKE
FINANCIAL ENTANGLEMENT.  DO YOU HAVE FINANCIAL
ENTANGLEMENT WITH ANYBODY?
     WHAT DO YOU THINK AFTER YOU SEE THIS
THING?  THIS IS A VERY SMALL COMPANY, A VERY
SIMPLE COMPANY.  THESE ARE THEIR REQUIREMENTS.
IMAGINE YOU ARE THE DATABASE PERSON SO YOU ARE
BEING ASKED TO DESIGN A DATABASE.  SO SOMEBODY
HAND YOU A DOCUMENT LIKE THIS.  IN FREE TEXT.
IN PLAIN ENGLISH LIKE THIS.
     STUDENT:   I'D ASK THEM WHAT THEY
WANT TO DO.
     PROFESSOR:   WHAT THEY WANT TO DO
WITH IT, YEAH, THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT
STEP, YEAH.  DEFINITELY.  YEAH, BUT WHAT
I'M DRIVING AT IS THAT IF YOU SEE THIS
THING, NOW THAT WE ALL HAVE SOME IDEA
ABOUT OBJECT ORIENTED POINT OF VIEW,
RIGHT?  OKAY.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT A PIECE OF
DOCUMENT LIKE THAT, BEING A SCIENTIST, WE
NEED TO CATEGORIZE AND GROUP THINGS.
     WHAT DO YOU SEE?
     STUDENT:   DO A NOUN EXTRACTION.
     PROFESSOR:   YES, THAT'S VERY GOOD.
YOURS IS ALSO GOOD.  THE THINGS THAT THEY
DO IS ACTUALLY CONVEYED BY VERBS BUT THE
ITEMS THE ENTITIES YOU DEAL WITH ARE
NORMALLY CONVEYED BY NOUN.  SO IF YOU LOOK
AT THE NOUNS IN THIS DOCUMENT, YOU WILL
SEE WHAT?
     STUDENT:   THEY'RE ALL FIELD NAMES.
     PROFESSOR:   THEY ARE ALL FIELD
NAMES?  OKAY.  OKAY LET'S START FROM THE
TOP.  THE FIRST NOUN WE ENCOUNTER IS
COMPANY.  OKAY.  THAT MUST BE A TOP LEVEL
ENTITY, RIGHT?  NEXT?  DEPARTMENT.  OKAY.
NEXT, NAME, NUMBER, MANAGER.  BUT SOMEHOW
YOU KNOW THAT DEPARTMENT AND NAME,
MANAGER, THESE ARE NOT INDEPENDENT, RIGHT?
OKAY.  WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP THEY MAY
HAVE?
     STUDENT:   MORE THAN ONE.
     STUDENT:   IT'S A TREE.
     STUDENT:   IT'S --
     PROFESSOR:   OKAY, SO, HE MADE VERY
GOOD SUGGESTION.  LET'S JUST IDENTIFY THE
NOUNS, SO I SEE MANY, OKAY.  I STARTED
FROM TOP, COMPANY, DEPARTMENT AND THEN
NAME, NUMBER, MANAGER.  THEY ARE NOT ALL
AT A SAME LEVEL, RIGHT?  ARE THEY?  NO.
OKAY.  SO, IF YOU LOOK DEPARTMENT, NAME,
NUMBER, MANAGER YES --
     STUDENT:   WOULDN'T NAME, NUMBER AND
DEPARTMENT ALL BE AT THE SAME LEVEL,
THOUGH?
     PROFESSOR:   THE NAME, NUMBER MANAGER
SEEM TO BE AT SAME LEVEL, RIGHT?
     STUDENT:   ACTUALLY I WOULD THINK
NAME NUMBER AND DEPARTMENT JUST BECAUSE
IT'S A DEPARTMENT WAY TO --
     PROFESSOR:   OKAY.  I THINK -- OKAY.
YOU'RE TRYING TO EXPRESSION IN -- EXPRESS
IN DIFFERENT WAY.  IF YOU LOOK AT
DEPARTMENT, EVEN THOUGH IT'S A NOUN,
ENTITY OR OBJECT, OKAY, THE DEPARTMENT HAS
SOME CHARACTERISTICS.
     STUDENT:   OKAY.
     PROFESSOR:   OR ATTRIBUTES WHICH
ARE --
     STUDENT:   NAME, NUMBER AND MANAGER.
     PROFESSOR:   NAME, NUMBER AND
MANAGER.  THAT'S WHAT I'M DRIVING AT.  IN
OTHER WORDS WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT
REQUIREMENTS, YOU CAN IDENTIFY CERTAIN
ENTITIES AND THOSE ENTITIES HAVE WHAT WE
CALL ATTRIBUTES.  OKAY.  LET ME REPEAT
THAT. IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU LOOK AT
REQUIREMENTS, YOU'LL FIRST DO THIS
ANALYSIS OF EXTRACTING NOUNS BECAUSE THE
NOUNS ARE MOST LIKELY ENTITIES, BUT THEY
ARE NOT ALL ENTITIES BECAUSE THEN IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE, IT'S A FLAT WORK.  SO SOME ARE
ENTITIES, THE OTHERS ARE NOT ENTITIES BUT
ATTRIBUTES.  OKAY.  SO DEPARTMENT,
DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE NAME, NUMBER OF
MANAGERS AS THEIR ADJECTIVES.  MANAGER IS
EMPLOYEE.  OKAY.  WHAT DO I MAKE OUT OF
THIS, MANAGER IS EMPLOYEE?
     STUDENT:   WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?
     PROFESSOR:   I HAVE TWO NOUNS,
MANAGER AND EMPLOYEE.  YES?
     STUDENT:   I WOULD MAKE EMPLOYEE BE
THE ENTITY.
     PROFESSOR:   EMPLOYEE SHOULD BE THE
ENTITY?  YEAH?  MANAGER?
     STUDENT:   I WOULD HAVE IT BE AN
ATTRIBUTE.
     PROFESSOR:   IN THIS CASE IT MAY BE
BUT CAN WE THINK ALSO AS A HIRE ARY,
RIGHT?  HIERARCHY.  SO WHICH ONE IS MORE
GENERAL?
     STUDENT:   EMPLOYEE.
     PROFESSOR:   EMPLOYEE IS MORE
GENERAL, RIGHT AND MANAGER IS -- RIGHT A
SUB CLASS OF THIS EMPLOYEE.  IN OTHER
WORDS YOU CAN ALSO SEE THAT THERE ARE
RELATIONSHIPS.  SOME ARE HIGHER SOME ARE
LOWER.
     DEPARTMENT HAS DIFFERENT LOCATION, SO
LOCATION OBVIOUSLY SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTES.
RIGHT.  DEPARTMENT CONTROLS PROJECTS.
PROJECT IS THAT AN ENTITY OR ATTRIBUTE?
     STUDENT:   ENTITY.
     PROFESSOR:   ENTITY, OKAY.  IN FACT,
SIMPLE RULE OF THUMB.  IT IS AN ENTITY IF
IT HAS OTHER ATTRIBUTES.  SEE, ATTRIBUTES
CANNOT HAVE ATTRIBUTES, ONLY ENTITIES CAN.
IF YOU LOOK AT PROJECT AND SAYS PROJECT
HAS NAME, NUMBER LOCATION, SO NAME,
NUMBER, LOCATION ARE OBVIOUSLY THE
ATTRIBUTES OF PROJECTS, THE PROJECT
NATURALLY SHOULD BE AN ENTITY.
     YES?
     STUDENT:   COULD A PROJECT BE AN
ATTRIBUTE OF THE DEPARTMENT?
     PROFESSOR:   YES.  WE WILL COME TO
THAT. IN OTHER WORDS LATER ON OF THE
EVERYTHING WILL BE RELATED.  YES
DEFINITELY.  THAT'S WHAT IT IS ABOUT,
RELATE EVERYTHING TOGETHER.  I WANT TO
SHOW THAT WHILE YOU READ THIS TEXT, BY
EXTRACTING THE NOUNS AND LOOKING AT THE --
LOOKING AT THEM AND DETERMINING WHAT THEY
ARE WE CAN HAVE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS
CONCEPTION MODEL IN TERMS OF ENTITIES AND
THEIR ATTRIBUTES.  THIS IS NOT A WHOLE
STORY LIKE I SAID.  WE ARE GOING TO RELATE
EVERYTHING TO EVERYTHING, OKAY.  BUT AT
LEAST THIS GIVE US AN INITIAL
UNDERSTANDING.  IN FACT, LATER ON WHEN I
BUILD MY DATABASE, THOSE ENTITIES WILL
COME IN HANDY.  EITHER THEY BECOME TABLES,
A RELATIONAL TABLE, OR THEY BECOME AN
OBJECT OR THEY BECOME CLASSES.  SO THAT'S
THE NATURAL WAY YOU CAN LOOK AT THINGS.
OKAY.  SO THIS GIVE US THE FIRST
APPROXIMATION TO OUR DESIGN.  NAMELY IF
YOU LOOK USER'S REQUIREMENTS THE USER,
THEY ARE THINKING IN TERMS OF REAL WORD
OBJECTS -- REAL WORLD OBJECTS.  AND THOSE
REAL WORLD OBJECTS, WE CAPTURE THAT AS
ENTITIES.  AND IT'S NOT THAT EASY I MUST
SAY.  THAT WE COME UP WITH THE SAME
CONCEPT.  IN FACT, ONCE I HAD A CONSULTING
EXPERIENCE WHERE I WAS IN SMALL COMPANY
AND THEY WANTED TO CARRY OUT OBJECT
RELATED DESIGN.  FOUR PEOPLE IN THE GROUP,
THEY COME UP WITH FIVE DIFFERENT MODELS.
SO NO TWO PERSONS THINK ALIKE.  IT'S
INTERESTING, FOUR PEOPLE, THE NUMBER OF
MODELS GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE.
ONE PERSON HE CAME UP WITH TWO MODELS.
FIGHTING AGAINST HIMSELF.  A SPLIT
PERSONALITY.  THAT HAPPENS.  IN OTHER
WORDS, EACH ONE OF US WILL SEE THE WORK IN
A DIFFERENT WAY.  THAT'S QUITE POSSIBLE.
OF COURSE, IT TAKES A LOT OF
COMMUNICATION.  WE NEED TO TALK TO THE
USER, SO WHEN THE USER SEES THE DESIGN HE
SAYS, OKAY, THIS IS ACCEPTABLE, THIS IS
WHAT I HAVE IN MIND.
     SO ENTITY IS AN OBJECT IN THE REAL
WORLD.  IT HAS TO BE VERY FIRED BY THE
USER THAT HE AGREES.  AND ENTITY HAS
PROPERTIES AND THESE PROPERTIES ARE CALLED
ATTRIBUTES.  AND I THINK SOMEONE SAID
FIELDS.  DID YOU SAY FIELDS?  DID SOMEBODY
SAY FIELDS?  FIELD IS ALSO CORRECT.  FIELD
IS AN OLDER NAME BUT WE GO INTO THE RECORD
IS CALLED FIELD.
     AND ENTITY CAN HAVE ATTRIBUTES AND
THIS ATTRIBUTES CAN TAKE ON SPECIFIC
VALUES.  AND SOME ATTRIBUTES ARE SIMPLE.
LIKE THE ZIP CODE, THE ZIP CODE CANNOT BE
SUB DIVIDE.  ACTUALLY THAT'S NO LONGER
TRUE.  NOW WE HAVE EXTENDED ZIP CODE BY
ADDING FOUR DIGITS.  OR IT COULD BE COME
POT IS -- COMPOSITE BECAUSE THE ADDRESS
CAN BE SUB DIVIDED INTO STREET ADDRESS AND
APARTMENT NUMBER, CITY, ET CETERA.  COULD
BE SINGLE-VALUED OR MULTIPLE-VALUED LIKE
AGE IS SINGLE VALUED.  MULTIVALUE LIKE
DEGREE BECAUSE ONE PERSON CAN TAKE ON A
NUMBER OF DEGREES.  AND SOME ATTRIBUTE CAN
BE DERIVED.  SO IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO
STORE AGE IN THE DATABASE, RIGHT?  BECAUSE
THAT CHANGES QUITE OFTEN.  BUT IF YOU
STORE THE DATABASE YOU CAN CALCULATE AGE
FROM THAT.
     AND FINALLY THE ATTRIBUTE MAY HAVE
SO-CALLED NULL VALUES, MEANING THAT THIS
FIELD IS EITHER UNDEFINED OR UNKNOWN OR
NOT APPLICABLE.  THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF
INTERPRETING THE NULL.  SO THIS IS
ACTUALLY AN INTERESTING THING BUT THAT'S
FOR THE MOMENT NOT GO DEEPER THAN THAT.
OKAY.  SO, WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS DOCUMENT.  YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THE PRIMARY ENTITIES
AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES.  OKAY.  SO I SAID
THIS IS THE FIRST IN YOUR DESIGN.  DOESN'T
CAPTURE ALL OF THE INFORMATION BUT A LOT.
SO, NOW LET ME JUST GO AROUND RANDOMLY SO
THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THE MOST IMPORTANT
ENTITIES AND ATTRIBUTES FOR THIS COMPANY
DATABASE.  LET'S START FROM YOUNG LADY?
JUST GIVE ME ANY ENTITY FROM THIS
COLLECTION?
     STUDENT:   DEPARTMENT.
     PROFESSOR:   DEPARTMENT.  AND WHAT IS
ITS ATTRIBUTE?
     STUDENT:   MANAGER.  NAME, NUMBER.
     PROFESSOR:   NAME AND NUMBER.  OKAY.
NEXT?  ANOTHER ENTITY.
     STUDENT:   PROJECT.
     PROFESSOR:   PROJECT.
     STUDENT:   NAME, NUMBER AND LOCATION.
     PROFESSOR:   NAME, NUMBER, LOCATION.
     STUDENT:   EMPLOYEE.
     PROFESSOR:   EMPLOYEE.
     STUDENT:   NAME, SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBER, ADDRESS, SALARY, SEX, BIRTHDATE,
HOURS, PROJECT, DEPENDENTS.
     PROFESSOR:   OKAY.  SOME OF THESE WE
CAN DISCUSS LATER.  I JUST COPIED WHATEVER
YOU SAY.  EMPLOYEE.  ANY MORE ENTITIES?
     STUDENT:   DEPENDENTS WITH NAME, SEX.
     PROFESSOR:   DEPENDENTS.
     STUDENT:   NAME, SEX, BIRTHDATE AND
RELATIONSHIP.
     PROFESSOR:   AGAIN I'M JUST GOING TO
COMPANY DOWN WHATEVER YOU SAY, OKAY?  ANY
MORE?
     STUDENT:   COMPANY.
     PROFESSOR:   COMPANY.  ANY
ATTRIBUTES?
     STUDENT:   NO.
     PROFESSOR:   NO ATTRIBUTES YET.  ANY
MORE?
     STUDENT:   MANAGER.
     PROFESSOR:   MANAGER.
     STUDENT:   BECAUSE IT HAS A STARTING
DATE.
     PROFESSOR:   ITS ATTRIBUTES?
     STUDENT:   STARTING DATE.
     PROFESSOR:   STARTING DATE.  THAT'S
ALL?
     STUDENT:   HE'S AN EMPLOYEE.
     PROFESSOR:   MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE A
NAME OR SOMETHING, RIGHT?
     STUDENT:   HE'S PROBABLY ALREADY
UNDER EMPLOYEE TABLE.
     PROFESSOR:   OKAY.  YEAH.  SO YOU SAY
OKAY.  MAYBE IT'S UNDER EMPLOYEE TABLE BUT
HOW DO WE EXPRESS THAT?
     STUDENT:   WOULDN'T YOU ADD START
DATE AS ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES UNDER
EMPLOYEE AND THAT WOULD BE NULL --
     PROFESSOR:   AS I WRITE THIS DOWN YOU
ALREADY HAVE SOME QUESTION MARK IN YOUR
HEAD, RIGHT?  NOT EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE
EXPRESSIBLE THIS WAY YES, SIR?
     STUDENT:   DEPARTMENT UNDER ATTRIBUTE
OF COMPANY?
     PROFESSOR:   YES THEY SHOULD BE SOME
KIND OF RELATIONSHIP.
     STUDENT:   DEPARTMENT IS ALREADY AN
ATTRIBUTE.  IT CAN'T HAVE AN ATTRIBUTE.
SAME THING WITH MANAGER.  MANAGER CANNOT
BE AN ENTITY BECAUSE IT --
     PROFESSOR:   WE STARTED BY WRITING
DOWN ADJECTIVES.  SOME ARE
NONCONTROVERSIAL.  NOBODY WILL DISPUTE
THAT DEPARTMENT IS ENTITY.  PROJECT IS
ENTITY AND EMPLOYEE IS ENTITY.  BUT AS WE
EXHAUST THE LIST, YOU ARE GETTING INTO
SOME UNCERTAIN GROUND.  YOU BEGIN TO
REALIZE THAT JUST BE LOOKING AT ENTITIES
ALONE, NOT ENOUGH.  AND OF COURSE THAT'S
THE OTHER PART OF THE PICTURE.  YOU ARE
BEGINNING TO SEE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE
RELATIONSHIPS.  THE WORD IS RELATIONSHIPS,
RIGHT?  YES?  RELATIONSHIP IS WHAT MAKE
PEOPLE HAPPY.  IT'S VERY DEEP.  ANY WAY,
THAT'S THE PART THAT'S NOT YET DISCUSSED
HERE.  BUT THAT'S -- IN OTHER WORDS, LET
ME CONCLUDE THIS, FROM THE USER
REQUIREMENTS, WE AS DESIGNER, THE FIRST
THING WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IS IDENTIFY
THE ENTITIES AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES.  THEN
WE NEED TO DO A ANALYSIS AND THAT WILL
COME TUESDAY, HOW WE EXPRESS
RELATIONSHIPS.  OKAY.  THAT'S IT.





PROFESSOR: THIS LECTURE HAS THREE PARTS AND THIS IS SECOND PART. THE ENTIRE LECTURE IS IN THIS FILE.



PROFESSOR: WE WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF THE DATABASE.  TO
START FROM THE USER REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE
USUALLY EXPRESSED IN NATURAL LANGUAGE, IN
ENGLISH AND BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO
A CONCEPTED DESIGN.  NOW THIS DESIGN WE
CAN CAPTURE USING A MODEL CALLED ENTITY
ENTITY RELATIONSHIP MODEL.  YOUR JOB FOR
YOUR FIRST EXERCISE IS TO TAKE A
DESCRIPTION IN THE EXERCISE AND TRANSLATE
THAT INTO THE ER DIAGRAM AND THOSE WILL
COME UP IN THE SCHEMA.  YOU'LL NEED TO DO
BOTH.  SO LAST TIME WE STARTED WITH THIS
REQUIREMENTS, IT'S VERY TYPICAL ONE.  THEY
DESCRIBE THE BASIC ENTITIES IN A CERTAIN
ENTER PRICE AND WE MENTIONED THAT YOU
FIRST SHOULD ISOLATE THE NOUNS SO THAT YOU
CAN LOOK AT THE DESCRIPTION AND IDENTIFY
THE MOST NATURAL OBJECTS.  AND IN THIS
CASE ARE THE FOLLOWING ENTITIES.  THE
DEPARTMENT, THE PROJECT AND EMPLOYEE AND
DEPENDENT.  THESE TURN OUT TO BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT ENTITIES THAT WE'LL COME ACROSS.
NOW ONE THING I SHOULD CAUTION YOU IS THAT
THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A UNIQUE DESIGN.
IN OTHER WORDS, DIFFERENT DESIGNERS COULD
COME UP WITH DIFFERENT ENTITY TYPES AND
THEN LATER ON IMPLEMENT THAT AS A
DIFFERENT SET OF RELATIONS.  SO WHEN A
TEACHING ASSISTANT IS GRADING OR WHEN I'M
GRADING, I'M NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING FOR
UNIQUE DESIGN.  SOMETIMES THERE IS NO
UNIQUE DESIGN.  RATHER, THERE EXISTS A
GOOD DESIGN WHICH YOU SHOULD ENDEAVOR
TRYING TO FIND.
     OKAY.  NOW, ASIDE FROM THE ENTITIES,
WE NOTICE THAT MANY OF THE WORDS, MANY OF
THE NOUNS, ACTUALLY ARE NOT ENTITIES BY
THEMSELVES, RATHER THEY ARE THE PROPERTIES
OR CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE ENTITIES.  SO
THESE WILL CAP -- SO THESE WE'LL CAPTURE
AND CALL THE ATTRIBUTES.  SO LIKE IN THIS
EXAMPLE, BY THE WAY MANY OF YOU SHOULD
HAVE ALREADY PRINTED OUT CLASS NOTES.  IF
YOU HAVE NOT, YOU CAN DO THAT BEFORE THE
CLASS, THAT CERTAINLY WILL HELP.
     NOW, HERE YOU SEE EXAMPLE OF SOME
TYPICAL INSTANCES OF THE ENTITIES.  SO
HERE WE HAVE MAYBE AN EMPLOYEE INSTANCE.
SO WITH NAME, ADDRESS, AGE AND HOME PHONE,
ET CETERA.  AND HERE MAYBE INSTANCE OF A
COMPANY WITH THE NAME OF THE COMPANY,
HEADQUARTER AND THE PRESIDENT.
     NOW, IF YOU TAKE THE REAL VALUE AWAY,
IF YOU TAKE AWAY THOSE VALUES, YOU END UP
WITH THE STRUCTURE OR THE TYPE.  SO, I CAN
DEFINE AN EMPLOYEE ENTITY TYPE.  AND THEN
WITHIN THAT TYPE I HAVE THE ATTRIBUTES,
NAME, ADDRESS, HOME PHONE AND THEN WE CAN
POPULATE A DATABASE WITH THIS INSTANCES
AND THEN THEY TAKE ON THOSE VALUES.
     SO THE ENTITIES ARE OBJECTS IN THE
REAL WORLD.  BY REAL WORLD WE MEAN A
CERTAIN ENTER PRICE, SUCH AS OUR EXAMPLE
THIS COMPANY.  NOW, IN THE EXERCISE, THE
REAL WORLD IS FOR A TYPICAL CLASSROOM
ENVIRONMENT, SO YOU WILL HAVE STUDENTS AND
COURSES.  SO THESE ENTITIES HAVE
PROPERTIES CALLED ATTRIBUTES AND THE
ATTRIBUTES CAN TAKE ON VALUES.  AND
ATTRIBUTES COULD BE SIMPLE ATTRIBUTES,
COMPOSITE LIKE ADDRESS.  I HAVE AN EXAMPLE
SHOWING THE COMPOSITE ATTRIBUTE BECAUSE WE
ALL KNOW THE ADDRESS CAN BE COMPOSED INTO
ITS CONSTITUENT PARTS.
     AND SOME A ATTRIBUTES COULD BE STORED.
     LIKE I JUST MENTIONED, IF I TAKE THE REAL
VALUE AWAY, THEN WE END UP WITH THE DEFINITION
OF WHAT WE CALL THE TYPES.  SO THE ENTITY TYPE
IS REALLY THE STRUCTURE THAT WE USE TO DEFINE
THE ENTITIES.  SO THE ENTITY TYPES WILL HAVE A
SET OF ENTITIES HAVING THE SAME ATTRIBUTES AND
THEN WE CAN DESCRIBE THOSE ENTITY TYPES WITH
THE SCHEMA.  SO IF YOU COME UP WITH -- SO ONCE
YOU COME UP WITH THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN YOU CAN
CAPTURE THAT IN THE SCHEMA.  IN THE EXERCISE,
REMEMBER, I DON'T JUST WANT A SCHEMA I ALSO
WANT THE GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATION USING THE ER
DIAGRAM.  SO YOU NEED TO GIVE ME BOTH, ER
DIAGRAM AND SCHEMA.  OKAY?
 OKAY.  NOW HERE IS A CORRESPONDENCE OF
THE VARIOUS NAMES.  IN DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY.
SO HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ENTITY TYPE AND
ENTITY INSTANCES.  SO ENTITY IS MORE LIKE A
NEUTRAL TERM, REFERRING TO THOSE REAL WORLD
CLASSES THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY.  IN OBJECT WE
CALL THEM OBJECT TYPE AND OBJECT INSTANCES.
IN THE RELATIONAL DATABASE SETTING THE ENTITY
TYPE WILL BECOME THE RELATION.  OR IF YOU
PREFER THE TABLE.  AND THE INSTANCES ARE THE
TUPLES OR ROWS IN THE TABLE.  AND LAST BUT NOT
LEAST IN LOGIC, IN MATHEMATICAL LOGIC THE
ENTITY IS WHAT WE CALL THE INTENTION AND
WHAT'S IN THE ENTITY OF THE INSTANCES ARE WHAT
WE CALL THE EXTENSION.  YOU CAN SEE THAT FROM
DIFFERENT DISCIPLINE.  NOT THAT WE DON'T HAVE
CONCEPT -- THE CONCEPTS ARE THERE BUT IT'S
CALLED DIFFERENTLY.  OKAY.
 SO NOW LET'S GO BACK TO OUR HYPOTHETICAL
COMPANY.  AS I MENTIONED, WHEN WE FIRST MAKE
INITIAL ANALYSIS LAST TIME I ASKED SOME OF YOU
TO START IDENTIFYING THOSE ENTITY TYPES.  AND
AT FIRST IT'S EASY BUT AS WE BEGIN TO EXHAUST
THE LIST OF ALL OF THOSE ENTITIES, THEN WE
BEGIN TO TROD ON SHAKY GROUND BECAUSE NOW WE
ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST ENTITIES BUT ALSO
TALKING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG ENTITIES.
THAT'S WHY THE MODEL IS CALLED ER SO THE FIRST
PART IS E WHICH IS ENTITY AND SECOND PART IS R.
     SO WE IDENTIFIED THOSE ATTRIBUTES AND
THE DISTINGUISHED ATTRIBUTES AS COMPOSITE
ATTRIBUTES, MULTIVALUED ATTRIBUTES, BY THE
WAY, MULTIVALUED ATTRIBUTES ARE ATTRIBUTES
WITH MULTIPLE VALUES SUCH AS IF I TALK
ABOUT A DEGREE OF A PERSON, THINGS A
PERSON CAN HAVE ANYWHERE FROM ZERO TO MANY
DEGREES SO THAT CAN BE MULTIPLE VALUE.
BUT WE HAVE TO WATCH OUT BECAUSE ONCE WE
IMPLEMENT THAT RELATIONAL DATABASE, IN A
RELATIONAL DATABASE IT DOES NOT ALLOW
MULTIPLE VALUE ATTRIBUTES.  OKAY?  SO, WE
HAVE TO -- BE A LITTLE CLEVER TO MAKE SOME
KIND OF SUBSTITUTION.  USUALLY USING SOME
KIND OF CLEVER CODING SCHEME.  BY THAT I
MEAN, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU ALLOW THE PERSON
TO HAVE BACHELOR, MASTER AND PH.D. DEGREE
THERE IS A NATURAL WAY TO PROVIDE MAYBE A
THREE BIT CODING.  0300 MEANS NO DEGREE
AND 001-OR 111 MEANS ALL THREE DEGREES.
YOU CAN USE CLEVER CODING SO YOU CAN STORE
INFORMATION IN THE DATABASE BECAUSE
RELATIONAL DATABASE DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO
DEFINE MULTIVALUE ATTRIBUTES.
     OKAY.  AND THEN WE ALSO TO IDENTIFY
THE KEYS.  NOW THE KEYS ARE VERY
IMPORTANT.  THE KEYS ARE THE UNIQUE
ATTRIBUTE OR ATTRIBUTES SO THAT WE CAN
IDENTIFY A PARTICULAR TUPLE OR PARTICULAR
INSTANCE.  SO IF WE GO BACK TO OUR
EXAMPLE, THE EMPLOYEE EXAMPLE, WHAT WOULD
BE THE KEY IN THIS CASE?  YEAH?
     STUDENT:   WITH THAT YOU HAVE NO
GUARANTEE THE UNIQUE KEY.
     PROFESSOR:   BECAUSE?
     STUDENT:   YOU COULD HAVE TWO JOHN
SMITHS WHO ARE AGE 55 MAKE 80-K AND ARE IN
THE SAME COMPANY.
     PROFESSOR:   YEAH.
     STUDENT:   THAT WOULD BE BAD.
     PROFESSOR:   THAT WOULD BE BAD.  IN
OTHER WORDS, OKAY.  FIRST, HYPOTHETICALLY
IF EVERY ONE HAVE A UNIQUE NAME THEN THAT
NAME WE CAN USE AS THE KEY.  SO, IN THAT
CASE, THIS KEY WILL BE THE NAME ATTRIBUTE.
BUT HE IS QUITE RIGHT BECAUSE YOU COULD
HAVE THE SAME NAME EVEN THE SAME AGE,
OKAY?  BUT THE SALARY MUST BE DIFFERENT.
     STUDENT:   NO.
     PROFESSOR:   OKAY.
     STUDENT:   IF I HAVE TWO ASSISTANT
PROGRAMMERS WHO MAKE $44,000 A YEAR BOTH
HAPPENED TO BE NAMED JOHN SMITH AND 44
YEARS OLD.
     PROFESSOR:   OKAY.  THEN CAN WE HAVE
TWO IDENTICAL INSTANCES?  CAN BE?  THE
ANSWER IS NO.  BECAUSE THIS MEANS THAT WE
HAVE NOT DONE A GOOD JOB TO CONCEPTUALIZE
OUR DATABASE.  REMEMBER THE DATABASE IS
ABSTRACTION.  WE ABSTRACT FROM THE REAL
WORLD.  SO HERE UP TO JOHN SMITH, SAME
NAME, SAGE AND SAME SALARY.  I CAN
REPRESENT THEM AS TWO DIFFERENT INSTANCES
IN MY DATABASE.  WHOSE FAULT IS THIS?
DESIGNER'S.  WE HAVE TO GO FARTHER TO FIND
SOME OTHER CHARACTERISTICS THAT
DISTINGUISH THEM, TOO.  OKAY?
     THAT'S ONE MORE REASON ONE OTHER KEYS
LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS VALUABLE.
WHY?  BECAUSE WE ARE ASSIGNED A NUMBER --
IN TRUTH THERE ARE DUPLICATES, BUT LET'S
FORGET ABOUT THOSE MINOR CASES.  THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE UNIQUE.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT.  YOU USE THE SOCIAL
SECURITY NUMBER AS THE KEY ATTRIBUTE.  BUT
THIS DISCUSSION ALSO POINT OUT THAT IN THE
WORST CASE YOU CAN USE COMBINATION AS
ATTRIBUTES AS KEYS.  THE WORST CASE WHAT
IS?  I ICED THE COMBINATION OF ALL THE
ATTRIBUTES AS KEYS.  BUT THAT IS NOT A
VERY GOOD IDEA BECAUSE ONCE YOU CONSTRUCT
AN INDEX THAT INDEX WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE
TO MAINTAIN.  SO WHEN WE GO TO STORAGE
TECH TEAKS WE WILL DISCUSS THAT, BUT
REMEMBER THAT KEYS ARE IMPORTANT FROM THE
PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW.  OKAY.  SO BY NOW
WE HAVE FINISHED ONE PART OF DATABASE
DESIGN.  IN OTHER WORDS, WE ARE ABLE TO
CAPTURE THE ENTITIES FROM OUR DESCRIPTION
BUT WE ARE NOT TOTALLY HAPPY, OKAY?
BECAUSE WE QUICKLY NOTICE THERE ARE
CERTAIN THINGS IN THIS REQUIREMENTS
SPECIFICATION THAT WE CANNOT CAPTURE.  SO
PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT TELL ME WHAT WE HAVE
NOT BEEN ABLE TO CAPTURE.
     STUDENT:   THE DEPARTMENT CAN'T HAVE
SEVERAL LOCATIONS BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID
BEFORE, MULTIVALUED ATTRIBUTES.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  ANYTHING ELSE?
     STUDENT:   WE'RE NOT KEEPING TRACK OF
THE HOURS.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  AND THE REASON
BEING?
     STUDENT:   WE HAVEN'T CREATED AN
ENTITY FOR IT.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  BECAUSE WHY WE
CANNOT CAPTURE THAT?
     STUDENT:   THERE IS -- YOU HAVEN'T
CREATED SPACE FOR IT.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  IN OTHER WORDS
WE HAVEN'T CAPTURED THIS RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE EMPLOYEE AND HOW-WHAT PROJECT
HE WORKS FOR, HOW MANY HOURS.  YES?  YOU
RAISED YOUR HAND?
     STUDENT:   WE DIDN'T SAY THAT A
MANAGER IS AN EMPLOYEE.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  AGAIN, THE
RELATIONSHIP.  SO YOU CAN EASILY SEE THAT
ALL OF THESE ARE VERY SIMILAR THERE ARE
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN
ABLE TO EXPRESS BECAUSE SO FAR WE ARE ABLE
TO CAPTURE THE CONCRETE ENTITIES, OBJECT,
YOU ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP?
SO THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IN
THE MODEL.
     LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE FIRST
DIAGRAM IN THE NOTES.  SO I HAVE THESE TWO
ENTITY TYPES.  THE EMPLOYEE ENTITY TYPE
AND THE DEPARTMENT ENTITY TYPE.  THAT WE
ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THROUGH OUR INITIAL
ANALYSIS.  SO I KNOW THE EMPLOYEE HAS
CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES, DEPARTMENT HAS CERTAIN
ATTRIBUTES.  BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
CAPTURE AS HE POINTED OUT, FOR EXAMPLE,
THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED FOR A CERTAIN
PROJECT, FOR A CERTAIN DEPARTMENT BY A
CERTAIN EMPLOYEE.  NOW THESE CAN ONLY BE
CAPTURED, WE HAVE THIS WORKED FOR
RELATIONSHIP.  OKAY.  SO THE WORK FOR
RELATIONSHIP FROM A MATHEMATICAL POINT OF
VIEW IS A MAPPING.  THE MAPPING WILL TAKE
THE ELEMENTS FROM A CERTAIN SET AND MAP IT
OR LINK IT TO ELEMENTS OF ANOTHER SET.
AND MATHEMATICALLY WE HAVE -- ANY
MATHEMATICIANS AMONG US?  DIFFERENT TYPE
OF MAPPING?  ANYONE KNOWS?  WE HAVE ONE TO
ONE MAPPING, ONE TO MANY MAPPING, MANY TO
MANY MAPPING, YOU SHOULD HAVE STUDIED THIS
BUT THE CONCEPT IS QUITE EASY TO EXPLAIN.
     SUPPOSE THIS EMPLOYEE, E1 THIS
EMPLOYEE INSTANCE, AND HE WORKS FOR
DEPARTMENT D1 THEN WE CAN RELATE THEM,
RIGHT?  SO E1 WORKS FOR D1.  AND E2 WORKS
FOR D-2 AND E3 WORKS FOR D-1.  AND SO ON,
SO FORTH.  NOTICE THAT EACH EMPLOYEE CAN
WORK FOR EXACTLY ONE DEPARTMENT.  OKAY?
SO EVERY INSTANCE HERE WILL BE ASSOCIATED
WITH SOME INSTANCE HERE.  IT'S THE -- IS
THE CONVERSE TRUE?  NO.  RIGHT.  WE CAN
LOOK AT THIS.  THIS SHOWS VERY CLEARLY,
DEPARTMENT D1 ACTUALLY HAS TWO -- THREE
EMPLOYEES.  E1, E3 AND WHATEVER.  E6.
OKAY.  SO THIS IS MANY TO ONE MAPPING.
MANY EMPLOYEES CAN BE MAPPED TO THE SAME,
THE ONE DEPARTMENT.  MANY TO ONE MAPPING.
NOTICE THAT THIS MAPPING WHICH WE CALL THE
RELATION FROM THE COMPUTER SCIENCE POINT
OF VIEW IS CREATING A KIND OF LINK.
LINKING THE INSTANCE OF RECORDS FROM THE
ONE SET TO THE INSTANCES OR RECORD OF
ANOTHER SET.  THIS IS THE PART THAT WE
FAIL TO CAPTURE USING THE ENTITIES AND
THAT'S WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS ABOUT.
     SO THE WAY WE SAY THAT IS THAT WE
HAVE ENTITY TYPES, ENTITY TYPES CAN BE
RELATED USING THE RELATIONSHIP TYPES.  AND
THE WAY WE SAY THAT IS WE SAY THE ENTITY
TYPE PARTICIPATES IN A RELATIONSHIP TYPE.
FOR EXAMPLE, EMPLOYEE AND DEPARTMENT, THEY
BOTH PARTICIPATE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP WORK
FOR THAT I JUST SHOWED TO YOU.
     AND SINCE THEY ARE TWO ENTITY TYPES
PARTICIPATING WE CALL THIS RELATIONSHIP
THE DEGREE OF TWO.  SO THE WORKS FOR
RELATIONS HAS DEGREE 2.  THIS MEANS TWO
ENTITY TYPES ENTER INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP.
AND IN FACT THE PARTICIPANT ENTITIES CAN
HAVE DIFFERENT ROLE NAMES.  ALIASES.  THE
REASON BEING IF I HAVE AN EMPLOYEE THEN IN
THIS CASE IT'S BE RELATED TO THE
DEPARTMENT USING THE WORKS FOR RELATION
BUT MAYBE THE EMPLOYEE ARE ALSO SOCCER
PLAYERS, OKAY, I CAN HAVE ANOTHER RELATION
TO FORM SOCCER TEAMS.  IN OTHER WORDS,
ENTITY CAN PLAY MANY DIFFERENT ROLES, SO
EMPLOYEE CAN BE IN ONE ROLE AN EMPLOYEE
AND IN ANOTHER ROLE A PLAYER.  THESE ARE
DIFFERENT ROLES A PERSON CAN PLAY.  IN
THIS CASE THE EMPLOYEE PLAYS THE ROLE
EMPLOYEE IN LOWER CASE IN THIS
RELATIONSHIP.
     OKAY.  THEY COULD BE MORE THAN ONE OR
MORE THAN TWO.  ENTITY TYPES ENGAGED IN A
RELATIONSHIP.  AND HERE'S AN EXAMPLE THAT
WE'RE GOING TO USE THROUGHOUT OUR
DISCUSSION SO WE HAVE SUPPLIERS THAT
SUPPLIES CERTAIN THINGS, WE HAVE PARTS,
THE PARTS WILL BE USED BY CERTAIN PROJECTS
AND THE PARTS ARE SUPPLIED BY CERTAIN
SUPPLIERS.  OKAY.  SO NOTICE THAT BETWEEN
SUPPLY AND PART THERE CAN BE A
RELATIONSHIP.  SUPPLIER SUPPLIES PARTS.
BETWEEN SUPPLIER AND PROJECT, THERE IS A
RELATIONSHIP.  THE SUPPLIER SUPPLIES TO
CERTAIN PROJECT.  BETWEEN PART AND PROJECT
THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP.  THE PROJECT WILL
USE CERTAIN PARTS.  BUT IF YOU CONSIDER
EVERYTHING TOGETHER, WHAT THIS DIAGRAM
MEANS IN OUR NATURAL LANGUAGE IS THAT A
CERTAIN PROJECT WILL USE CERTAIN PARTS
SUPPLIED BY CERTAIN SUPPLIER.  THAT'S
SO-CALLED THREE WAY RELATIONSHIP.  YOU CAN
GO TO HIGHER DIM MENTIONS BY MOST HELPFUL
IS BINARY RELATIONSHIP AND IN THIS CASE
TERTIARY, THE DEGREE IS THREE.
     FINALLY, RECURSIVE RELATIONSHIP.
SOMEONE JUST SAID THAT WE HAVE NOT
IDENTIFIED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYEE
AND HIS BOSS.  OR HER BOSS.  BUT IF YOU
COME TO THINK ABOUT IT, EMPLOYEE CAN BE A
SUPER VISOR.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE SUPER
VISOR IS ALSO AN EMPLOYEE SO THAT IS THIS
RECURSIVE NATURE.  A CERTAIN PERSON CAN
PLAY DIFFERENT ROLES SO WE HAVE THIS
RELATIONSHIP OF RECURSIVE RELATIONSHIP SO
EMPLOYEE ONE, E1 FOR EXAMPLE, HE IS SUPER
VISED BY EMPLOYEE E5.  THROUGH THIS SUPER
VISION RELATIONSHIP.  SO E5 HIMSELF IS
ALSO EMPLOYEE, THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THIS --
SO INSTEAD OF TWO ENTITY TYPES, THEY ARE
COLLAPSED INTO THE SAME ONE.  SEE, THIS IS
WHERE YOU NEED DIFFERENT ROLES BECAUSE
EMPLOYEE CAN ALSO BE SUPER VISOR.  THESE
ARE TWO DIFFERENT ROLES, AS THEY SAY, TWO
DIFFERENT HATS, YOU CAN WEAR, SO THAT IS
IDENTIFIED BY THE ROLE NAMES.  YOU WILL
USE ALIASES TO DO THAT.
     STUDENT:   DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN
THAT RELATIONSHIP AGAIN THERE?  YOU'RE
SHOWING SUPER VISOR TO EMPLOYEE?
     PROFESSOR:   YEAH.  FOR EXAMPLE I
HAVE EMPLOYEE E1 AND E1 IS SUPER VISED BY
EMPLOYEE E5.
     STUDENT:   OKAY.
     PROFESSOR:   NOW, NORMALLY IF I
REALLY IMPLEMENT THAT, WHAT I DO IS
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.  NOW I'M GOING TO
DRAW THIS IN TABULAR FORM BECAUSE THAT'S
THE EASIEST WAY.  THIS IS MAYBE EMPLOYEE
ID NUMBER.  THIS EMPLOYEE IS E1 AND HE IS
SUPER VISED BY A SUPERVISOR SO I WILL HAVE
A COLUMN CALLED THE SUPERVISOR'S ID
NUMBER.  AND HERE IF HE'S SUPER VISED BY
E5, I PUT THAT E5.
     STUDENT:   I'M CONFUSED ON THE LINES
DRAWING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SUPER
VISION AND EMPLOYEE.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  THIS IS NOT A
VERY EASY WAY TO EXPRESS IT.  BECAUSE
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S TOO DENSE, TOO MANY
LINKS.  ALSO IT DOESN'T SHOW THE DIRECTION
OF THIS RELATIONSHIP AND THAT'S WHY WE
NEED A BETTER GRAPHIC TOOL WHICH IS WHAT
ER DIAGRAM IS FOR.  I AGREE THIS DIAGRAM
IS --
     STUDENT:   IF YOU THROW SOMETHING
LIKE THAT ON AN EXAM, IT WOULD MAKE NO
SENSE.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT, THIS IS SHOWING
THE CONCEPT OF MAPPING BUT DOESN'T GIVE
YOU THE CONCEPT OF RELATIONSHIP.  BUT ER
DIAGRAM WILL CAPTURE THIS IN MUCH BETTER
WAY.
     BUT IF I BUT DOWN LIKE THIS, YOU
UNDERSTAND IMMEDIATELY, NO PROBLEM, RIGHT?
BUT REMEMBER, THIS IS OUR OBJECTIVE THIS
IS OUR TARGET.  YOU START BY TALKING TO
YOUR CUSTOMER SO IT CUSTOMER WILL GIVE YOU
THE REQUIREMENTS TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO
THIS ER DIAGRAM AND THEN YOU TRANSLATE
THAT INTO SCHEMA AND FINALLY COME UP WITH
THE TABLE.
     BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN JUMP AHEAD.  IF
YOU COME RIGHT AWAY AND YOU CAN COME UP
WITH A DATABASE DESIGN, THAT'S FINE.  BUT
NOTICE THAT THIS BYPASS, THIS REQUIREMENT
THE SPECIFICATION STAGE, LATER ON WHEN YOU
TRY TO EXPLAIN THE DESIGN TO SOMEONE ELSE
YOU RUN INTO PROBLEM BECAUSE BY AND LARGE
PEOPLE REACT TO THE GRAPHICAL NOTATION
VERY WELL.  ONCE THEY LOOK AT A DIAGRAM
THEY IMMEDIATELY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
     STUDENT:   IS E2 SUPER VISED BY E1 IN
THAT?
     PROFESSOR:   YES.
     STUDENT:   OKAY.  THANK YOU.
     PROFESSOR:   YES.
     STUDENT:   I WANTED TO SEE IF I WAS
GETTING IT.
     PROFESSOR:   WELL, WHAT'S BAD IS THAT
THIS DIAGRAM DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE
DIRECTION.  YOU REALLY SHOULD, OKAY.
SOMEBODY'S PHONE IS RINGING.  BETTER TURN
THAT OFF.  OKAY?
     OKAY.
     AND WE TALK ABOUT RECURSIVE ROLES AND
FINALLY WE TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TYPE
OF MAPPINGS, ONE TO ONE, ONE TO ONE IS
LIKE LET'S SAY HAVE YOU SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBER AND STUDENT ID NUMBER.  BOTH ARE
UNIQUE.  OKAY?  THEY HAVE ONE TO ONE
MAPPING.  OR IF WE ARE LUCKY, IF THE NAMES
ARE UNIQUE THEN BETWEEN NAME AND ASSOCIATE
SECURITY NUMBER THERE IS ALSO ONE TO ONE
MAPPING.  IF IT IS ONE TO ONE THIS MEANS
YOU CAN SUBSTITUTE ONE BY THE OTHER WITH
NO LOSS.  ONE TO MANY WE JUST EXPLAIN THAT
SO IF I HAVE PEOPLE WORKING FOR DIFFERENT
DEPARTMENTS AND ONE PERSON, ONE EMPLOYEE
CAN ONLY WORK FOR ONE DEPARTMENT, THEN I
HAVE THIS ONE TO MANY MAPPING.  FINALLY
MANY TO MANY.  THIS IS THE MORE COMPLEX
TYPE OF RELATIONSHIPS LIKE THE SUPPLIER
AND PART.  ONE SUPPLIER CAN SUPPLY SEVERAL
DIFFERENT PARTS BUT EVERY PART CAN ALSO BE
SUPPLIED BY MULTIPLE SUPPLIERS.  THEN HAVE
YOU YOUR MANY TO MANY RELATIONSHIP.
     OKAY.  PARTICIPATION CONSTRAINTS.
THIS IS THE NOTION OF TOTAL PARTICIPATION
OR PARTIAL PARTICIPATION.  WE JUST TALKED
ABOUT EMPLOYEE.  IF OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT
EMPLOYEE MUST WORK FOR A DEPARTMENT, THEN
WHEN YOU SHOW THE MAPPING, THERE WILL BE A
LINE FOR EVERY EMPLOYEE.  OKAY?  EVERY
EMPLOYEE WILL HAVE A LINE BECAUSE
EVERYBODY MUST WORK, EVERYBODY MUST WORK
FOR SOME DEPARTMENT.
     BUT SUPPOSE SOME EMPLOYEE DOESN'T
HAVE TO WORK FOR ANY DEPARTMENT?  IS THERE
SUCH A CASE?  YEAH, THERE IS SUCH A CASE.
THERE COULD BE A CONSULTANT.  THEY ARE
FREE.  THEY ARE NOT ATTACHED TO ANYTHING
PERMANENT.  YOU WILL NOT SEE A LINE HERE.
SOME OF THOSE GUYS WILL NOT BE ASSOCIATED
WITH ANY DEPARTMENT.  IT COULD BE THE
CONVERSE IS TRUE.  SOME DEPARTMENT WILL
HAVE NO EMPLOYEE.  MAYBE THIS IS AN
OBSOLETE DEPARTMENT, IT EXISTS IN NAME,
BUT NOT IN REALITY.  SO, IF THE MAPPING IS
COMPLETE -- JUST A MINUTE.  OKAY.  THIS
MEANS THAT PARTICIPATION IS TOTAL.  EVERY
ELEMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OTHERWISE
IT IS CALLED PARTIAL.  THE MIN,MAX
NOTATION I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.  MAYBE I'LL
EXPLAIN IT NOW AND IF YOU ARE CONFUSED
I'LL EXPLAIN IT LATER.  NOW IF YOU HAVE AN
INSTANCE, THE MIN,MAX NOTATION TELLS YOU
THE MINIMAL NUMBER OF TIMES AND MAXIMUM
NUMBER OF TIMES IT CAN PARTICIPATE IN A
RELATIONSHIP.  THE BEST EXAMPLE IS THE
MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIP OKAY.  MONOGAMOUS
RELATIONSHIP, THIS NUMBER SHOULD BE ZERO
AND ONE.  IN OTHER WORDS, EITHER YOU'RE
NOT MARRIED OR YOU'RE MARRIED.  ZERO,1.
SO THIS IS THE MINIMAL NUMBER OF TIMES YOU
CAN PARTICIPATE IN MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIP.
THIS IS THE MAXIMUM ONE.  IF YOU GO TO
UTAH, FOR THE MEN IT'S ZERO AND INFINITY,
RIGHT?  HOW ABOUT FOR THE WOMAN?  IN UTAH?
ZERO,1.  STILL THIS ONE.  BUT FOR THE MEN
IT'S THIS.  THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.  SO
THIS SHOWS YOU HOW MANY TIMES YOU ENTER
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.
     NOW LET'S LOOK AT OUR PREVIOUS
EXAMPLE, THE WORKS ON.  SO EMPLOYEE WORKS
ON A PROJECT.  A RELATIONSHIP IS MANY TO
MANY BECAUSE EVERY EMPLOYEE CAN WORK ON
SEVERAL PROJECTS AND EVERY PROJECT MAY
HAVE SEVERAL EMPLOYEES.  IS THIS ALWAYS
TRUE?  MAYBE NOT.  MAYBE SOME COMPANY HAS
A RULE, EVERY EMPLOYEE MUST WORK FOR ONLY
ONE PROJECT AT A TIME.  THEN THIS
RELATIONSHIP IS NO LONGER MANY TO ONE.  IT
SHOULD BE MANY TO MANY.  NOTHING HERE IS
SAY CREDIT.  SO YOU MAY DEFINE WORKS FOR
RELATIONSHIP.  DOES IT HAVE TO BE MANY TO
MANY?  NOT NECESSARILY SO.  UNTIL YOU TELL
ME UNTIL THE CUSTOMER, THE CLIENT TELLS
US.  BUT THEN THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO I
KNOW, AS A DESIGNER HOW DO I CHOOSE?  YOU
TALK TO THE USER, YOU TALK TO THE CLIENT,
RIGHT?  IF THE CLIENT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT DO
YOU DO?
     STUDENT:   YOU KEEP ASKING UNTIL YOU
FIND SOMEONE WHO DOES OR YOU MAKE IT AS
FLEXIBLE AS YOU CAN AND WHEN YOU FIND
SOMEONE THAT KNOWS --
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  YOU HAVE TO MAKE
SOME REASONABLE DECISION TO SEE WHAT WILL
BE A REASONABLE DESIGN, OKAY?  SO IF -- IF
THE CLIENT SAYS WE DON'T KNOW, WE DON'T
KNOW WHETHER THERE IS SUCH A CASE, OKAY?
THEN YOUR BEST EDUCATED GUESS IS THAT
WELL, EMPLOYEE CAN BE A LOUD TO WORK ON
MULTIPLE PROJECTS, RIGHT?  OKAY.  THIS HAS
TO BE IN A DESIGN DOCUMENT BECAUSE
OTHERWISE LATER ON YOU FORGET.  OKAY?  SO,
GOING BACK TO YOUR EXERCISE, WHAT I ASKED
YOU TO DO IS VERY SIMPLE PROBLEM.  YOU
TAKE THE UNIVERSITY ENVIRONMENT, YOU TRY
TO CAPTURE THAT WITH YOUR DESIGN IF IN
FORM OF THIS ER DIAGRAM.  YOU WILL MAKE
DESIGN DECISIONS LIKE THIS.  FOR EACH
DECISION YOU MAKE LIKE YOU SAID
RELATIONSHIP MM YOU MAKE A FOOTNOTE.
WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS FOOTNOTE?  YES?
     STUDENT:   SO LATER ON YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU DID.
     PROFESSOR:   EXACTLY.  NOT ONLY YOU,
OR SOMEONE WHO SUCCEEDED YOU.  IN OTHER
WORDS IF YOU DON'T SPELL IT OUT, YOU CAN
FORGET.  WHAT IS VERY CLEAR AT THE MOMENT
AFTER THE DAY BECOMES HAZY, AFTER A WEEK,
IT'S DONE.  SO, THIS IS WHY YOU NEED TO
DOCUMENT THAT.  NOW, THE WAY THAT I'M
GOING TO ASK THE TA TO GRADE IT IS THE
SAME.  IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN COME UP WITH
A DESIGN AND THEN YOU SHOULD ADD A -- ADD
A FEW FOOTNOTES TO THE TEACHING ASSISTANT,
ASSUMING HE IS THE READER OF THE DOCUMENT,
WHAT DESIGN IS ABOUT.  OKAY?
     OKAY.  NOW SUPPOSE WE WANT TO KEEP
TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS EMPLOYEE
WORKS FOR A PROJECT?  THIS IS ALSO THE
QUESTION THAT COME UP EARLIER.  SO, I HAVE
EMPLOYEE HERE THIS IS MY EMPLOYEE FILE.
SO THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED CAN I PUT IT
HERE?  YES?
     STUDENT:   NO, BECAUSE YOU COULD BE
ON DIFFERENT PROJECTS.
     PROFESSOR:   BECAUSE I COULD BE ON
DIFFERENT PROJECTS.  OKAY.  HOW ABOUT
THIS?  LET'S SAY THIS IS FOR PROJECT 15.
THAT'S A PROJECT NUMBER.  EVERY PROJECT
MUST HAVE A PROJECT NUMBER AND HOURS
WORKED.  SO FOR PROJECT 15, P-15 I SPENT
10 HOURS.  HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
     STUDENT:   YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT
OF REPEATED INFORMATION ON THAT TABLE.
     PROFESSOR:   OKAY.  I HAVE A LOT OF
REPEATED INFORMATION ON THE TABLE.
TRANSLATE INTO LAYMAN LANGUAGE FOR ME.
     STUDENT:   IF YOU SET UP A SEPARATE
TABLE THAT WILL JUST MAP TOGETHER AN
EMPLOYEE, PROJECT AND NUMBER OF HOURS,
THAT WHICH WAY YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE TO
ENTER IT ONCE.  YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO
REPEAT EMPLOYEE NUMBER AND SUPERVISOR ID
FOR EACH PROJECT.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  IN OTHER WORDS
WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THAT THESE TWO FIELD,
I USED THE WORD FIELD, THIS IS AN OLDER
TERM, OR ATTRIBUTES, MAY OCCUR ZERO OR
MORE TIMES FOR THAT RECORD, RIGHT?  THE
PERSON MAY NOT WORK FOR ANY PROJECT BUT HE
MAY WORK FOR MULTIPLE PROJECTS THEN I
MIGHT HAVE WHAT IS CALLED A REPEATING
GROUP.  THIS HAS TO BE REPEATED BUT THIS
IS BAD, RIGHT?  BECAUSE THIS MEANS THAT I
DON'T HAVE A TABLE ANY MORE, THE TABLE CAN
HAVE MANY DIFFERENT ENTRIES.  THIS IS NOT
TOO COOL.  SO THAT'S NOT GOOD.  THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ANOTHER WAY BECAUSE
BASICALLY WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE IS
THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE TOO MUCH IN
THIS TABLE.  I HAVE EMPLOYEE, I HAVE
PROJECT.  EMPLOYEE WORKS FOR PROJECT FOR
SO MANY HOURS.  YOU MIGHT WANT TO SQUEEZE
EVERYTHING IN HERE.  YES, I CAN DO THAT,
OKAY, IN FACT THE VERY FIRST DATABASE
SYSTEM DID IT EXACTLY THIS WAY.  YOU
SQUEEZE EVERYTHING INTO VARIABLE RECORD
BUT MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE DON'T HAVE TO DO
IT ANYMORE.  SO A MORE CLEANER DESIGNS
THAT WE KEEP TWO ENTITY TYPES.  ONE FOR
EMPLOYEE, THE OTHER FOR PROJECTS AND THEN
WE CAN AD HOURS TO THE WORK ON
RELATIONSHIP SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THIS.
I HAVE EMPLOYEE AND PROJECT.  THEY ENTER
INTO MANY TO MANY RELATIONSHIP AND
EMPLOYEE WORKS FOR PROJECT FOR A CERTAIN
NUMBER OF HOURS.  IT IS NEITHER HERE NOR
THERE BUT WHERE?  HERE.  IN OTHER WORDS I
SHOULD BE ADDING INFORMATION TO THE
RELATIONS.
     STUDENT:   DOESN'T THE RELATIONSHIP
DESCRIBE THE TWO -- HOW THE TWO ENTITIES
ARE RELATED?  IN OTHER WORDS, WHY WOULD
HOURS BE AN ATTRIBUTE OF RELATIONSHIP AS
OPPOSED TO BEING AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE
ENTITY PROJECT?
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.
     STUDENT:   THERE MAY BE OTHER
ENTITIES BESIDES HOURS WORKED.
     PROFESSOR:   IF I TRY TO PUT IT INTO
PROJECT ENTITY I RUN INTO SAME PROBLEMS.
RIGHT?  IF I BUILD UP THE PROJECT TABLE
HERE, SO FOR PROJECT P-15, HOURS WORKED,
CAN DO THAT BECAUSE I'VE IDENTIFIED
EMPLOYEE AS WELL.
     STUDENT:   RIGHT YOU USE A UNIQUE --
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.
     STUDENT:   AN ADDITIONAL ATTRIBUTE.
     PROFESSOR:   EXACTLY.  IN OTHER WORDS
I HAVE REPEATING GROUPS OCCURRING IN MY
PROJECT TABLE NOW.
     STUDENT:   NO.
     PROFESSOR:   YES.
     STUDENT:   IF ONE FIELD DESCRIBES AN
EMPLOYEE HE'S ONLY WORKING ON --
     PROFESSOR:   YEAH BUT FOR THAT
PROJECT I MAY HAVE 15 EMPLOYEES.
     STUDENT:   RIGHT.
     PROFESSOR:   I HAVE TO STORE THIS
SOMEWHERE.  RIGHT?
     STUDENT:   OKAY.  SO YOU WANT TO --
     PROFESSOR:   I WANT TO TAKE THAT OUT.
OTHERWISE I GET -- IT GETS MESSY.  I WANT
TO KEEP IT IN A SEPARATE RELATIONSHIP.
WELL, WHEN YOU ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT A
DATABASE ALL THESE GUYS BECOME RELATIONAL
TABLES.  SO DON'T WORRY ONCE YOU GET INTO
RELATION DATABASE EVERYTHING BECOMES
TABLES, INCLUDING THE RELATIONSHIP.  OTHER
QUESTIONS?
     OKAY.  SO, WE NOW CAN TALK ABOUT
ALMOST TALK ABOUT INITIAL DESIGN FROM THE
USER'S REQUIREMENTS.  OKAY.  SO WE
IDENTIFIED THESE FOUR ENTITY TYPES AND FOR
EVERY ENTITY YOU IDENTIFY THE ATTRIBUTES.
WHATEVER I PUT IN BRACKETS THIS MEANS
MULTIPLE VALUED ATTRIBUTES WHICH I ALREADY
TOLD YOU IS A NO-NO IN RELATIONAL
DATABASE.  IN RELATIONAL DATABASE YOU HAVE
TO FIND SOME WAY TO GET RID OF THAT. SO
THE DEPARTMENT HAS MULTIPLE RELATIONS,
THAT IS A MULTIVALUED ATTRIBUTE SO I USED
A BRACKET THERE.  WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT
IN THE RELATIONAL DATABASE WE GET RID OF
THAT.
     NOW, WHAT WE JUST DISCUSSED, THE
WORKS ON, I CAN HIDE IT UNDER EMPLOYEE
ENTITY TYPE LIKE I SHOWED HERE, SO IF I
HAVE EMPLOYEE IT CAN HAVE DIFFERENT
PROJECT, DIFFERENT HOURS.  LIKE I SAID,
THIS GETS UGLY.  YOU HAVE A REPEATING
GROUP THERE.
     SO, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET RID OF
THAT.  I JUST SHOWED IT HERE SO YOU'LL SEE
HOW WE DO THAT IN OLD FASHIONED WAY WHICH
IS NOT TOO GOOD.  ANY QUESTIONS?
     OKAY.  TOGETHER WITH THIS YOU SHOULD
COME UP WITH THE RELATIONSHIP.  WE KNOW
THAT EMPLOYEE AND DEPARTMENT HAS A
RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE EVERY DEPARTMENT
REQUIRES A MANAGER, RIGHT?  SO, WE HAVE
THIS RELATIONSHIP THE EMPLOYEE MANAGES
DEPARTMENT.  AND THE ONE TO ONE IS OUR
ASSUMPTION.  WE ASSUME EVERY DEPARTMENT IS
MANAGED BY EXACTLY ONE PERSON.  AND ALSO
THERE IS NO VACANCY.  IS THAT VACANCY?  NO
VACANCY.  WE SAY DEPARTMENT IS TOTAL.
THIS MEANS EVERY DEPARTMENT MUST BE
MANAGED BY SOMEONE.  WHAT DO I MEAN WHEN I
SAY EMPLOYEE PARTIAL?  YES?
     STUDENT:   NOT EVERY EMPLOYEE HAS TO
BE A MANAGER.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  ALSO NOT EVERY
EMPLOYEE CAN BE A MANAGER, RIGHT.  NOW YOU
HAVE MORE EMPLOYEES THAN DEPARTMENTS.
THAT'S WHY WE PUT PARTIAL HERE.  AND THE
ATTRIBUTE OF THIS MANAGED RELATIONSHIP,
NOW THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET ACROSS.
IN OTHER WORDS, THIS RELATIONSHIP TYPE CAN
HAVE ATTRIBUTE AS WELL.  SO THIS EMPLOYEE
START TO MANAGE THIS DEPARTMENT FROM A
CERTAIN DATE.  SO I PUT START DATE THERE.
     IN OTHER WORDS, I RECORD THE FACTS OF
THE STARTING DATE OF THIS MANAGEMENT
ASSIGNMENT.  THE WORKS FOR, SO EVERY
EMPLOYEE MUST WORK FOR SOME DEPARTMENT AND
EVERY DEPARTMENT MUST HAVE SOMEONE WORKING
FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO THOSE ARE TOTAL
PARTICIPATION.
     IT'S A ONE TO MANY RELATIONSHIP
BECAUSE EVERY DEPARTMENT MAY HAVE MANY
EMPLOYEES.  THE PROJECT IS CONTROLLED BY
THE DEPARTMENT.  EVERY PROJECT MUST BE
CONTROLLED BY CERTAIN DEPARTMENT.
OTHERWISE NOBODY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.
NO GOOD.  BUT THE -- BUT THERE ARE
DEPARTMENTS THAT DO NOT CONTROL ANY
PROJECT.  SO DEPARTMENT IS PARTIAL
PARTICIPATION, PROJECT IS TOTAL.  IT'S
ALSO A ONE TO MANY RELATIONSHIP.  SUPER
VISION, REMEMBER WE TALK ABOUT THAT.  THIS
IS A RECURSIVE RELATIONSHIP.  THE
RELATIONSHIP OF SOME ENTITY TYPE WITH
ITSELF.  PLAYING DIFFERENT ROLES.  OKAY.
SO, WE HAVE TWO HAT, THE EMPLOYEE HAT AND
ONE IS THE MANAGER HAT.  SO, NOT EVERY
EMPLOYEE IS A MANAGER AND NOT EVERY
EMPLOYEE IS MANAGED BY ANYBODY SO THESE
ARE BOTH PARTIAL ONE TO MANY.
     STUDENT:   YOU SAID NOT EVERY
EMPLOYEE IS MANAGED BY SOMEONE.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  ACCORDING TO
THIS SPECIFICATION.  IF YOU DISAGREE YOU
CAN CHANGE IT TO TOTAL AND MAKE A FOOTNOTE
SO YOUR ASSUMPTION, YOUR DESIGN ASSUMPTION
IS THAT EVERY EMPLOYEE MUST BE MANAGED BY
SOMEBODY.  BUT LIKE I SAID, IF THIS
COMPANY HAS FREELANCE CONSULTANT, THIS IS
CORRECT THEN.  YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?  A LOT
OF THESE ARE ASSUMPTIONS.
     EVERY EMPLOYEE MUST WORK ON
SOMETHING.  AND EVERY PROJECT MUST HAVE
SOMEONE WORKING ON IT, AND THE ATTRIBUTE
HOURS RECORD HOW MANY HOURS YOU WORK ON A
CERTAIN PROJECT.
     SO FAR SO GOOD, RIGHT?  OKAY.  THE
LAST ONE GIVE US SOME TROUBLE.  THIS IS
CALLED A DEPENDENT.  NOW FOR INSURANCE AND
FOR MANY REASONS WE NEED TO RECORD THE
DEPENDENTS OF A CERTAIN EMPLOYEE THE
DEPARTMENT -- THE DEPENDENTS REALLY DON'T
HAVE THE RIGHT OF EXISTENCE BY THEMSELVES
BECAUSE UNLESS THEY ARE DEPENDENTS OF
SOMEONE, OF SOME EMPLOYEE, THE COMPANY
COULDN'T CARE LESS.  RIGHT?  SO THIS MEANS
THAT DEPENDENTS CANNOT BE REGARDED AS A
SEPARATE ENTITY TYPE BY THEMSELVES.
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT OF
EXISTING BY THEMSELVES AND THIS WHAT WE
CALL THE WEAK ENTITY.  THAT MEANS -- WEAK
LINKS?  MAYBE THEY ARE.  BUT WEAK IN THE
SENSE THEY DON'T HAVE EXISTENCE IN THEIR
OWN RIGHT SO THEY MUST BE DEPENDENT ON
SOMETHING ELSE, NAMELY EMPLOYEE
THEMSELVES.  SO HERE IS EXAMPLE.  YOU HAVE
JOAN DOE HAS A DEPENDENT CINDY.  MARRY --
MARY COULD BE JOHN'S WIFE BUT THEY BOTH
WORK FOR THIS COMPANY.  AND SHOW SHE HAS A
DEPENDENT CINDY.  SO TWO DEPENDENTS CAN BE
THE SAME, IDENTICAL DEPENDENTS.  WE CANNOT
MAKE THAT SEPARATE ENTITIES BECAUSE THEY
ARE ACTUALLY ONE AND THE SAME, SO THE
POINT HERE IS THAT THESE WEAK ENTITY TYPES
MUST BE OWNED BY SOME OWNER ENTITY TYPES.
CAN SOMEBODY GIVE ME ANOTHER EXAMPLE
RATHER THAN DEPENDENT?  YES?
     STUDENT:   THE SALARY?
     STUDENT:   EMPLOYEE SALARY.
     PROFESSOR:   EMPLOYEE SALARY IS AN
ATTRIBUTE.
     STUDENT:   DEGREES?
     PROFESSOR:   DEGREES?  DEGREES IS
ALSO ATTRIBUTE.
     STUDENT:   COMPANY VEHICLE.
     PROFESSOR:   COMPANY VEHICLE.  THAT'S
A GOOD EXAMPLE.  THE REASON I SAID DEGREES
AND WHAT'S YOUR EXAMPLE?
     STUDENT:   SALARY.
     PROFESSOR:   SALARY, OKAY, BECAUSE
THE DEGREES THERE ARE ONLY THREE DISCRETE
VALUES, SALARY IS ALSO DISCRETE VALUE AND
YOU DON'T IDENTIFY ALE PARTICULAR SALARY
AND GIVE IT ANY MEANING, SO IF THE SALARY
IS 40,000 AND 40,001, THERE ISN'T MEANING
TO THAT. BUT COMPANY VEHICLES, THERE COULD
BE A FLEET OF COMPANY VEHICLES.  BUT
ACTUALLY UNLESS THEY ASSIGN TO THE
EMPLOYEES -- OKAY.  OKAY.  SO, NOW IS
THIS -- WITH THIS PREPARATION WE CAN START
TO LOOK AT A DIAGRAM.
     STUDENT:   CAN I ASK A QUESTION
BEFORE YOU MOVE TO THAT. IN YOUR PREVIOUS
SLIDE YOU DID WORKS ON RELATIONSHIP.
     PROFESSOR:   YES.
     STUDENT:   I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
MISSED SOMETHING THERE.  WHY DO YOU HAVE
TOTAL FOR EMPLOYEE?  YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT
ALL EMPLOYEES ARE PART OF PROJECTS?
     PROFESSOR:   YES, THESE ARE ALL YOUR
ASSUMPTION, REMEMBER?
     STUDENT:   RIGHT.
     PROFESSOR:   SO IF YOU LOOK AT WORKS
ON, SO THE MANY TO MANY MEANS THAT EVERY
EMPLOYEE HERE CAN WORK ON MULTIPLE
PROJECTS.
     STUDENT:   THE ABILITY TO, RIGHT.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  EVERY PROJECT
MAY BE WORKED ON BY MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES.
     STUDENT:   BUT I MEAN TOTAL AS
COMPARED TO PARTIAL.
     PROFESSOR:   AGAIN, THIS IS THE
DESIGNER'S BEST GUESS, HE IS GUESSING THAT
EVERY EMPLOYEE MUST HAVE SOME PROJECT.
     STUDENT:   RIGHT BUT IN THE WORST
CASE SCENARIO, IF YOU'RE NOT SURE THERE
MAY BE SOME THAT DON'T WOULDN'T THAT BET
RIGHT --
     PROFESSOR:   YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THIS
TO PARTIAL, THIS MEANS SOMEONE WILL HAVE
NO PROJECT.
     STUDENT:   WHILE WE'RE HERE, THE
CONTROLS RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE ONE TO
MANY, IS THAT EVERY PROJECT CAN BE
UNDERSTOOD UNDER THE PROJECT OR EVERY
DEPARTMENT COULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE
PROJECT.
     PROFESSOR:   EVERY DEPARTMENT COULD
HAVE MULTIPLE PROJECTS.
     STUDENT:   OKAY.
     PROFESSOR:   NOW THE CONTROL IS VERY
IMPORTANT FOR QUALITY CONTROL REASONS.
NOW, IF YOU WORK FOR A COMPANY YOU BEGIN
TO REALIZE THAT QUALITY CONTROL IS THE BIG
THING, ESPECIALLY THESE DAYS, SO HAVE YOU
TO -- WHAT IS QUALITY CONTROL?  BASICALLY
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS --
SOMEBODY IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR EVERY FAILURE
AND THE WAY YOU TO DO THAT IS MAKE SURE
HAVE YOU THESE CONTROL RELATIONSHIPS.
     SO THIS MEANS THAT EVERY -- THAT'S
WHY IT'S TOTAL.  EVERY PROJECT MUST BE
CONTROLLED BY SOMEBODY.  BUT THERE ARE
DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE NO CONTROL OF ANY
PROJECT.  JANITOR DEPARTMENT.  SO, IN YOUR
EXERCISE, YOU'LL COME UP WITH THIS AND
MAKE AS MANY FOOTNOTES AS YOU THINK IS
NECESSARY.  MY INSTRUCTION IS TA IS IF YOU
HAVE NO FOOTNOTE YOU AUTOMATICALLY TAKE
OFF ONE POINT.  THIS MEANS HAVE YOU NO
ASSUMPTIONS.  THIS CANNOT BE YOU MUST MAKE
SOME ASSUMPTIONS.  CAN I MOVE ON NOW?
     OKAY.  NOW WE COME TO THE ER DIAGRAM.
WHAT I DO IS I EXPLAIN IT TODAY AND ON
THURSDAY WE'LL GO THROUGH THE SAME THING
ONCE MORE TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE
CONCEPT.  NOW, THE ER DIAGRAM TURNED OUT
TO BE A VERY GOOD TOOL.  NOT ONLY FOR
DATABASE DESIGN BUT IN GENERAL WHEN YOU
HAVE SOFTWARE PROJECT IT TURNED OUT TO BE
VERY USEFUL TOOL.  IN FACT, THERE ARE
GRAPHIC TOOLS, SOME OF THEM FREE, I'M SURE
YOU CAN FIND FREE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD TO HELP
YOU DOWNLOAD DIE GRAMS.  I WON'T BE
SURPRISED -- THIS IS NOT A REQUIREMENT,
IT'S ALL RIGHT IF YOU TURN IN EXERCISE
JUST USE HAND TO DRAW THE DIAGRAMS.  IF
YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE SOME NEAT COMPUTER TOOL
AND YOU WANT TO DO THAT, BE MY GUEST.
THERE ARE TOOLS THAT CAN GENERATE DIAGRAM
AND TRANSLATE INTO SOME SCHEMA.
     NOW, THOSE DIAGRAMS ARE VERY EASY TO
UNDERSTAND.  AND IT BECOMES A VERY USEFUL
PART OF ANY DOCUMENTATION BECAUSE AFTER A
WHILE, IF YOU FORGET ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE,
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?  YOU GO BACK AND
LOOK AT A DIAGRAM AND FOOTNOTE, THOSE
THINGS BEGIN TO COME BACK TO YOU.
NORMALLY WE LOOK AT A DIAGRAM BEFORE WE
LOOK AT PROGRAMS, MAKE LIFE MUCH EASIER
FOR US.  OKAY.  NOW LET'S GO TO THE
DIAGRAM.  NOW THE FIRST THING WE IDENTIFY
IS THOSE RECTANGLES.  THESE ARE ENTITIES.
SO YOU CAN EASILY SEE EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
PROJECT, THESE ARE ALL ENTITIES.  AND
NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE ELLIPSES THAT YOU
ATTACH TO THE ENTITIES ARE THE ATTRIBUTES.
IF YOU WANT TO DROUGHT ER DIAGRAM YOU
START WITH THIS, START WITH THOSE
RECTANGLES AND THEN YOU DRAW THOSE
ELLIPSIS.  THESE ARE EASIEST PART.  YOU
CREATE THOSE ENTITIES.  HOW ABOUT UNDER
LINED ATTRIBUTES?
     STUDENT:   KEYS.
     PROFESSOR:   KEYS.  OKAY.  SO LIKE IN
THIS CASE, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS A
KEY.  SO, SOMETIMES YOU WILL HAVE
ALTERNATE KEYS AND YOU UNDER LINE BOTH OF
THEM.  YES?
     STUDENT:   BOTH UNDER LINED, DOES
THAT MEAN YOU CAN USE ONE OR THE OTHER OR
DO YOU HAVE TO USE BOTH?
     PROFESSOR:   THAT'S A VERY GOOD
QUESTION.  IN THIS NOTATION, YOU CAN USE
ONE OR THE OTHER.  IF HAVE YOU TO USE
BOTH, WHAT I DO IS TO DRAW THOSE COMPOSITE
KEY IN THE FOLLOWING WAY.  LET'S SAY I USE
NAME AS A KEY AND NAME CAN BE FURTHER
DECOMPOSED INTO FIRST NAME AND LAST NAME.
AND NEITHER ALONE CAN BE THE KEY BECAUSE
LAST NAME IS NOT UNIQUE OF THE FIRST
NAME'S UNIQUE.  COMBINED IS UNIQUE, SO IN
MY ER DIAGRAM I DRAW LIKE THIS.  AND THEN
UNDERLINE THIS WHICH MEANS THAT THE NAME
FIELD WILL BE USED AS THE KEY.  THAT
ACTUALLY IS A COMPOSITE KEY, COMPOSED FROM
THIS PART AND THIS PART.  THIS HAPPENS --
THIS OFTEN HAPPENS.  IN OTHER WORDS, A KEY
FIELD OFTEN TIMES IS NOT A SINGLE
ATTRIBUTE.  BUT A COMPOSITE ATTRIBUTE LIKE
THIS.  OKAY.
     SO WE ARE DONE WITH THE ENTITIES, WE
ARE DONE WITH THE ATTRIBUTES.  AND NOTICE
SOME ATTRIBUTES IN THE DOUBLE CIRCLE.
THIS MEANS MULTIVALUED ATTRIBUTES LIKE
LOCATION.
     OKAY.  ONCE YOU ARE DONE WITH THE
ENTITIES, THEN YOU WORRY ABOUT RELATIONS.
THESE ARE THE DIAGRAMS.  OKAY.  FOR
EXAMPLE, LET'S START WITH THE WORKS FOR
RELATIONSHIP WORKS FOR IS THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN EMPLOYEE AND DEPARTMENT MANY
EMPLOYEES CAN WORK FOR THE SAME
DEPARTMENT, RIGHT?  SO I HAVE MANY ON THIS
SIDE ONE ON THIS SIDE.  THAT'S WHY I PUT N
HERE AND THE 1 HERE.  THIS IS THE EASIEST
WAY TO PUT THIS NOTATION ON.  SO IT'S VERY
CLEAR.  YOU LOOK AT THIS SIDE, ASK YOU
YOURSELF, CAN MANY PARTICIPATE?  YOU SAY
YES, WITH THE N.  1 YOU PUT DOWN ONE.  THE
DOUBLE LINE MEANS IS TOTAL, EVERY EMPLOYEE
MUST WORK WITH SOMEBODY.  EVERY DEPARTMENT
MUST HAVE SOME EMPLOYEE.  DOUBLE LINE.  WE
ARE ALMOST DONE EXCEPT THIS PART.  THIS IS
THE WEAK LINK, RIGHT.  THIS IS THE WEAK
ENTITY.  LIKE THE DEPENDENT IS A WEAK
ENTITY TYPE, SO WE PUT DOUBLE FRAME.  BY
THE WAY, THIS IS JUST ONE NOTATION.
SOMETIMES NOTATION VARIES, SO FOR
DIFFERENT TOOLS, NOTATION COULD BE
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.  OKAY.  SO FOR THE
DEPENDENT ENTITY TYPE, WE HAVE NAME, SEX,
BIRTHDATE, RELATIONSHIP.  RELATIONSHIP
MEANING.
     STUDENT:   FATHER, MOTHER, SISTER --
     PROFESSOR:   RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
DEPENDENT -- EMPLOYEE.  THESE DEPENDENTS
COULD BE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF A CERTAIN
EMPLOYEE, SPOUSE, OKAY?  SO, AS YOU CAN
SEE RELATIONSHIP ALSO DOES NOT HAVE
INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE.  IT MUST BE WITH
RESPECT TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEE.  THEY ARE
RELATED TO EMPLOYEE.  MANY DEPENDENTS WITH
ONE EMPLOYEE.  OH.  I ALMOST FORGOT THIS
THING.  SUPER VISION.  THE NOTATION FOR
THIS RECURSIVE RELATIONSHIP I THINK YOU
MENTIONED A WHILE AGO IS CONFUSING I
AGREE.  THAT'S WHY YOU SEE HERE YOU PUT
THE ROLES THERE.  ON THE ONE SIDE IS
SUPERVISOR AND THE OTHER SIDE IS
SUPERVISOR.  SUPERVISEE.  THAT NOTATION IS
NICE.  IT'S CLEAR.
     STUDENT:   WHY DON'T HAVE YOU DOUBLE
LINES THERE THEN?
     PROFESSOR:   DOUBLE LINE WHAT?
     STUDENT:   I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
DOUBLE LINE.  I THOUGHT --
     PROFESSOR:   THIS INDICATE IT IS WEAK
ENTITY TYPE.  THIS INDICATES IT'S A WEAK
RELATIONSHIP.
     STUDENT:   NO, NO.  OH, OKAY.  SO
DOUBLE LINES MEAN --
     PROFESSOR:   MEANS TOTAL.
     STUDENT:   MEANS TOTAL?
     PROFESSOR:   ALWAYS MEANS TOTAL.
EVERY DEPENDENT MUST BE RELATED TO SOME
EMPLOYEE, RIGHT?  OTHERWISE THE COMPANY
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THEM.
     STUDENT:   I SEE.
     PROFESSOR:   LIKE I SAID, LAST TIME,
IF WE ARE IN CMU THIS MODEL WILL CHANGE,
RIGHT?  BECAUSE THEIR DEFINITION OF THE
SPOUSE IS CHANGING.  YES?
     STUDENT:   SO FOLLOWING THAT THEORY,
WHY AREN'T THERE DOUBLE LINES BETWEEN
EMPLOYEE AND SUPERVISION?  ISN'T THAT
TOTAL COMMITMENT?
     PROFESSOR:   COULD BE, YOU'RE RIGHT.
COULD BE.
     STUDENT:   OUGHT TO BE A FOOTNOTE?
     PROFESSOR:   IT'S ALL YOUR
ASSUMPTION, RIGHT.
     STUDENT:   THE DOTTED ELLIPSE?
WHAT'S THAT?
     PROFESSOR:   THIS ONE?
     STUDENT:   THE DOTTED.
     STUDENT:   NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES.
     PROFESSOR:   YEAH, YEAH, AS YOU CAN
SEE, THIS IS A DERIVED ATTRIBUTE.  YOU
DON'T START NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN THE --
YOU DON'T STORE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN THE
DATABASE BECAUSE IT IS THE CARDINALITY OF
THAT RELATIONSHIP.  IF YOU PUT DOTTED LINE
IT MEANS IT CAN BE COMPUTED OR DERIVED.
SEE?  IT TOOK ME ONLY FIVE MINUTES TO
EXPLAIN EVERYTHING HERE TO YOU.  AND ALSO
THE RETENTION IS VERY HIGH.  IN OTHER
WORDS YOU WON'T FORGET.
     STUDENT:   THAT EMPLOYEE SUPERVISION
RELATIONSHIP, TO USE DOUBLE LINES THAT
WOULD ONLY BE THE CASE WHERE YOU ASSUME
THAT EVERY EMPLOYEE IS A SUPER VISOR?
     PROFESSOR:   IF I PUT IT ON THIS
SIDE, YES.  SO YOU CANNOT.  BUT I CAN PUT
IT ON THIS SIDE, IT MEANS EVERYBODY MUST
BE BOSSED AROUND BY SOMEBODY.
     STUDENT:   BY SOMEBODY, RIGHT.
     PROFESSOR:   YOU GOT IT.  YES?
     STUDENT:   WHEN HAVE YOU THAT
MANAGER'S RELATIONSHIP, YOU HAVE A SINGLE
LINE ON ONE SIDE AND DOUBLE LINE ON THE
OTHER BUT THEN WORKS FOR HAS TWO DOUBLE
LINES.  COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS?
THIS WORKS FOR HAS TWO DOUBLE LINES.
     PROFESSOR:   YEAH THIS MEANS THAT
EVERY EMPLOYEE MUST WORK FOR SOME
DEPARTMENT AND THIS DOUBLE LINE MEANS
EVERY DEPARTMENT MUST HAVE SOMEBODY WORKS
FOR IT.
     STUDENT:   WHAT I'M ASKING IS --
     PROFESSOR:   THESE ARE TOTAL
PARTICIPATION.
     STUDENT:   HAVE YOU DOUBLE LINES ON
ONE SIDE OF MANAGER AND SINGLE LINE ON THE
OTHER.  I'M WONDERING WHAT THAT
REPRESENTS.
     PROFESSOR:   YOU MEAN HERE?  OR
WHERE?
     STUDENT:   NOWHERE IT SENSE MANAGER.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  BECAUSE HERE A
DEPARTMENT MUST BE MANAGED BY SOME PERSON
BUT ON THIS SIDE IT'S NOT TRUE.  ANY
EMPLOYEE MAY NOT BE MANAGING ANY
DEPARTMENT.  AND THE ONE, ONE, EVERY
DEPARTMENT HAS ONE MANAGER.  SO THIS MEANS
THAT OKAY -- IT'S VERY EASY TO INTERPRET.
PARTIAL MEANS THAT HE MAY OR MAY NOT BE.
DOUBLE LINE MEANS MUST BE.
     STUDENT:   OKAY.
     PROFESSOR:   SO DEPARTMENT MUST BE
MANAGED BY SOME EMPLOYEE.  BUT EMPLOYEE
MAY OR MAY NOT MANAGE DEPARTMENT.  RIGHT?
     STUDENT:   HOW DID WE RESOLVE IF A
MARRIED COUPLE WORKS THERE, UNLESS I'M
READING THIS CORRECTLY, THE ONE ABOVE
DEPENDS OF, DOESN'T THAT MEAN THEY ONLY
ASSIGN THEM TO ONE.
     PROFESSOR:   IN THE DIAGRAM THAT
LOOKS LIKE THIS.  IN THE ACTUAL DATABASE,
BOTH JOHN AND MARY HERE RELATING TO THE
SAME CINDY.  YEAH?  RIGHT?  OKAY.  LIKE I
WAS SAYING, THIS ER DIAGRAM IS VERY USER
FRIENDLY, EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND YOU MAY
ASK TO GO BEYOND THAT AND THE ANSWER IS
FOR ME A QUALIFIED YES BECAUSE WE CAN GO
TO SO-CALLED U-M-L.  ANYONE HERE KNOW
ABOUT U-M-L?  IT'S A UNIVERSAL MODEL
LANGUAGE.  WE CAN MODEL EVERYTHING, ALL OF
THE PROCESSES.  AND IN FACT IT'S PART OF
THAT.  IT IS USEFUL.  SO -- IT'S NOT IN
YOUR NOTES BUT WE'LL ADD A LITTLE BIT ON
THAT.  ALSO NOT IN THE TEXTBOOK, I WANT TO
YOU BE AWARE OF THAT.  BECAUSE THESE ARE
MODERN TOOLS.  I WON'T BE SURPRISED A FEW
YEARS FROM NOW ER REPLACED BY UML.



PROFESSOR: THIS LECTURE HAS THREE PARTS AND THIS IS THIRD PART. THE ENTIRE LECTURE IS IN THIS FILE.


PROFESSOR:  SO LAST TIME WE
STARTED TO EXPLAIN ABOUT THE ER MODEL AND
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE QUESTIONS, SO WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO IS DISCUSS A BIT MORE.
OKAY.  FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO HAND IN FOR THE FIRST EXERCISE?
FOR THE FIRST EXERCISE, WHICH IS A DESIGN
EXERCISE.  YOU SEE, DESIGN MEANS THAT WE
CREATE SOMETHING.  SO IF YOU DESIGN A CAR,
YOUR DESIGN COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM
ANOTHER PERSON'S DESIGN.  BUT BOTH RUN.
BOTH ARE PERFECTLY GOOD CARS.  SO IN OTHER
WORDS, SINCE THIS IS A DESIGN PROBLEM, I
EXPECT A LOGICAL SOLUTION, A SOLUTION THAT
MEETS THE USER'S REQUIREMENTS BUT I DON'T
EXPECT A UNIQUE SOLUTION.  SO THEY ARE --
THERE ARE PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE
DESIGN CHOICES AND THOSE DESIGN DECISIONS
YOU MAKE, LIKE I SUGGEST, WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO PUT IN SOME FOOTNOTES.  SO, TO DO
THIS EXERCISE PROPERLY, YOU'LL HAVE THREE
THINGS.  THE FIRST IS THE ER DIAGRAM.  THE
SECOND IS THE SKI WHAT.  THE THIRD IS THE
NOTES.  SO LATER ON WHEN SOMEONE WILL
CHECK THE DESIGN, HE WILL LOOK AT ALL
THREE COME OPPONENTS AND HE CAN QUICKLY
UNDERSTAND YOUR DESIGN.  I'M NOT SAYING
THAT FOR THIS BECAUSE THIS EXERCISE,
OBVIOUSLY, PROBABLY WILL NOT BE USED BUT
IF YOU'RE DOING REAL DESIGN, ALL THREE
COME OPPONENTS WILL BE USEFUL.  LET ME
GIVE YOU MORE SIMPLE EXAMPLE WHICH I JUST
WENT OVER WITH A STUDENT AND THEN YOU SEE
WHAT I MEAN.  LET'S SAY WE HAVE EMPLOYEES
WHO ARE ASSIGNED TO WORK ON PROJECTS.
OKAY?  SO THIS IS THE SAME SITUATION WE
WENT OVER LAST TIME.  SO EMPLOYEE WILL
WORK ON PROJECT.  SO WE'LL COME UP WITH AN
ER DIAGRAM TO DESCRIBE THIS PART.  SO WE
MAKE EMPLOYEE AN ENTITY TYPE.  WE MAKE
PROJECT AN ENTITY TYPE.  NOW THERE IS NO
DISPUTE ON THAT, OKAY?  THIS IS UNIQUE.
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS,
I DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE -- ANYONE WILL
COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT ENTITY TYPE.  AND
THEN THEY HAVE RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS WORK
ON.  T SO EMPLOYEE CAN WORK ON PROJECT.
AGAIN, THE WORK ON RELATIONSHIP IS ALSO NO
DISPUTE, WHAT EVERYBODY WILL COME UP WITH.
SO, SO FAR SO GOOD.  SO, IF YOU THEY LOOK
AT IT YOU SHOULD HAVE A DIAGRAM LIKE THIS.
     WHAT AFTER THAT IS REALLY UP TO THE
DESIGNER?  OKAY.  SO, FIRST, WE HAVE TO
DECIDE WHETHER THIS ONE TO MANY, MANY TO
ONE OR MANY TO MANY MAPPING.  NOW THE IDEA
IS THIS.  SO HERE WE HAVE EMPLOYEES.  AND
HERE WE HAVE PROJECTS.  SO, IF THE COMPANY
DECIDES THAT EVERY PROJECT WILL HAVE A
GROUP OF EMPLOYEES WORKING ON THE PROJECT,
BUT NO EMPLOYEES WORKING ON TWO PROJECTS,
SEE WHAT I MEAN?  IN OTHER WORDS, THIS
WILL BE WHAT KIND OF MAPPING?  WHAT KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP?  YES?
     STUDENT:   ONE TO MANY?
     PROFESSOR:   ONE TO MANY?  WHICH SIDE
IS ONE?  WHICH SIDE IS MANY.
     STUDENT:   PROJECT SIDE.
     PROFESSOR:   PROJECT SIDE IS ONE.
THIS SIDE IS MANY, RIGHT?  SO YOU LOOK AT
THIS AND YOU COME UP WITH THIS DECISION.
     SOME OTHER COMPANIES MAY HAVE A
DIFFERENT PRACTICE.  THEY ALLOW ONE
EMPLOYEE TO WORK ON SEVERAL PROJECTS.
MAYBE FOR THE REASON OF EFFICIENCY.  AND
THIS WILL BE INDICATED FOR EXAMPLE HERE
THAT EMPLOYEE 2, E2 WILL BE WORKING ON
BOTH PROJECT ONE AND PROJECT 2.  WILL BE
INDICATE BY THIS LINE.  THEN YOU SEE IF
YOU LOOK AT THIS MAPPING, THIS DIAGRAM,
THIS NOTE -- THERE IS NO EACH WORKING ON
DIFFERENT PROJECT.  SO WHAT KIND OF
MAPPING IS THIS?
     STUDENT:   MANY TO MANY.
     PROFESSOR:   MANY TO MANY MAPPING.
SO IN THIS CASE I WILL WRITE DOWN --
DOESN'T MATTER WHICH SIDE IS M AND WHICH
SIDE IS N.
     THAT IS A DESIGN DECISION, OKAY?  AND
THAT IS WHERE YOU WILL COME UP WITH A
FOOTNOTE.  NOW THE QUESTION IS WHERE DO
YOU PUT THE FOOTNOTE?  WELL, THE FOOTNOTE
WILL COME WHEN YOU WRITE DOWN YOUR SCHEMA.
SO IN THIS CASE, THE SCHEMA IS JUST A
LINEAR REPRESENTATION OF THIS DIAGRAM.  IN
OTHER WORDS, HERE I DRAW THE DIAGRAM SO IT
IS MORE INTUITIVE.  BUT IF WE CONVERT INTO
SCHEMA FORM, THE SCHEMA WOULD LIKE WHAT
YOU SHOWED LAST TIME, EMPLOYEE WITH
ASSOCIATE SECURITY NUMBER, NAME, WHATNOT.
AND PROJECT WITH PROJECT NUMBER, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH.  AND THEN WE HAVE THE
RELATIONSHIP WORK ON.  WHICH ON ONE SIDE
WILL RELATE TO EMPLOYEE ON THE OTHER SIDE
WILL RELATE TO PROJECT.  AND MAYBE THE
HOURS THAT THIS EMPLOYEE WORKS FOR THAT
PROJECT.  AND NOW WE SAY THIS RELATIONSHIP
IS M-N RELATIONSHIP.  AND HERE IS WHERE
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A FOOTNOTE.  YOU CAN
USE SOME SYMBOL LIKE ASTERISK.  BUT IF YOU
HAVE MULTIPLE FOOTNOTES MAYBE BETTER TO
USE A NUMBER LIKE ONE.  OKAY.  AFTER THE
SCHEMA, YOU HAVE A SEPARATE SECTION OF
NOTES.  FOOTNOTES ARE SIMPLY NOTES.  NOTE
ONE, IS THAT THIS COMPANY ALLOWS EMPLOYEES
TO WORK ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROJECTS.  DO
YOU SEE WHY WE NEED THIS FOOTNOTE NOW?
WHY DO WE NEED THIS FOOTNOTE?
     STUDENT:   BECAUSE A DECISION HAD TO
BE MADE ON THE RELATIONSHIP AND TO JUSTIFY
WHY YOU MADE THAT DECISION.
     PROFESSOR:   CORRECT.  AND THIS
DECISION WE RECORDED THE DESIGNER
RECORDED, BUT ACTUALLY, IF HE REALLY COME
TO THAT, WE SOMETIMES GIVE AN INDICATE WHO
MADE THE DECISION, WHO MAKE THIS APPROVAL,
THIS IS FOR COMPANY'S APPROVAL PROCESS.
SO THAT THEY CAN SIGN OFF ON THAT. SO THIS
IS SOMETIMES WE EVEN HAVE HERE APPROVED BY
THE VICE PRESIDENT OF IT OR INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY OFFICE, OKAY?  THIS WILL BE
VERY GOOD BECAUSE LATER ON WHEN WE FOR
QUALITY CONTROL PURPOSES CHECK ON DESIGN
THEN WE KNOW WHO MADE THE DECISIONS AND
WHY WE DO THAT YES?
     STUDENT:   DO YOU WANT US TO
FABRICATE THESE THINGS AND PUT THEM IN --
     PROFESSOR:   NO, NO.  THIS IS JUST TO
GET IDEA ACROSS THAT A DESIGN IS NOT
UNIQUE, SECONDLY, IT REQUIRES MORE
EXPLANATION.  ER DIAGRAM IS NICE, OKAY,
BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE THE WHOLE PICTURE.
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO GET ACROSS.  SO
EVIDENTLY YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT ALL THESE
THINGS IN THERE.
     STUDENT:   SO REALLY ANY TIME PART OF
OUR DESIGN REQUIRES US TO MAKE A CHOICE,
WE SHOULD FOOTNOTE IT?
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  OF COURSE, I
DON'T WANT TO YOU OVERDO IT.  ALL I WANT
TO GET ACROSS IS THAT YOU NEED FOOTNOTES,
OKAY?  DON'T GIVE ME ANSWER WITH NO
FOOTNOTE, OKAY?  GIVE ME SOME.  BUT I
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT YOU TO ASK ME TO GIVE
ME A HUNDRED OF THEM.  WHAT'S WHAT I CALL
OVERDOING IT.  JUST A FEW.  TO WHET MY
APPETITE, PUT IT THAT WAY.
     QUESTIONS?  OKAY.  SO THIS THE PART
ABOUT M AND N.  THIS IS MAPPING BUSINESS.
AND THE OTHER PART IS ABOUT SO-CALLED
PARTICIPATION, TOTAL AND PARTIAL.  OKAY.
NOW FOR THE TOTAL AND PARTIAL, YOU NEED TO
LOOK AT EACH STYLE OF RELATIONSHIP
SEPARATELY.  OKAY?  SO FIRST WE LOOK AT
THIS SITE, EMPLOYEE SITE.  BASICALLY THIS
PARTICIPATION COMES SIMPLY SAYS THAT ARE
ALL THE MEMBERS INVOLVED IN A RELATIONSHIP
OR ONLY SOME?  OKAY.  SO IN THIS CASE, DO
WE ASSIGN PROJECT TO EVERY EMPLOYEE?
THAT'S THE QUESTION WE ASK.  IF THE ANSWER
IS QUESTION YOU PUT DOWN TOTAL.  IF YOU
ANSWER IS NO YOU PUT DOWN PARTIAL.  OKAY.
LET'S SAY THIS IS THE CASE WHERE ANSWER IS
YES, THEN YOU PUT DOWN TOTAL.  AND YOU
DRAW DOUBLE LINE.  OKAY.  SO THIS IS
EXAMPLE WHERE IT MAY OR MAY NOT DESERVE A
FOOTNOTE.  LIKE I SAID, IN THE SCHEMA YOU
COULD MAKE A FOOTNOTE THAT EMPLOYEE IS
TOTAL BUT THIS SEEMS SO OBVIOUS, RIGHT?
BECAUSE YOU DO WANT TO ASSIGN PROJECT TO
ALL EMPLOYEES THAT YOU MAY NOT WANT TO
GIVE FOOTNOTES.  IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GIVE FOOTNOTES FOR EVERY DECISION
YOU MAKE, JUST A REASON TO KNOW YOU
UNDERSTAND THE COULD CONCEPT.
     STUDENT:   MAYBE IT'S A STUPID
QUESTION, BUT WHY DID YOU MAKE DOUBLE
LINES BETWEEN EMPLOYEE AND WORK ON BUT NOT
ON WORK ON PROJECT.
     PROFESSOR:   I'M COME TOGETHER OTHER
SIDE.  WE HAVE TO DO EACH SIDE SEPARATE.
THE TOTAL AND PORTION, THAT'S THE WHOLE
POINT.  WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS ONE AS
WELL AS THIS ONE.  AND IN FACT, IT MAY BE
DIFFERENT.  BUT NOW LET'S COME TO THIS
SIDE.  OKAY.  SO THIS SIDE THE QUESTION
IS, DOES EVERY PROJECT HAVE SOME EMPLOYEE
OR NOT?  MAYBE, RIGHT?  BECAUSE SOME
PROJECTS ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY
OBSOLETE, SO IT'S STILL THERE IN NAMES,
BUT NOBODY'S WORKING ON THAT.  SO THE
PARTICIPATION SHOULD BE PARTIAL.  THIS
ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION.  EACH TIME YOU HAVE
TO HANDLE THAT DIFFERENTLY.  SO COMING
BACK TO THE DIAGRAM.  SO WE HAVE THIS
RELATIONSHIP AND WE HAVE PARTICIPATION
CONSTRAINT.  OKAY.  NOW, THIS IS NICE AND
THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT I PREFER, IT'S
INTUITIVELY CLEAR BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY
OF DOING BUSINESS.  SO INSTEAD OF DOING
THIS WAY, WE CAN COMBINE THE TWO AND USE
THE MIN,MAX NOTATION.  FOR THE MIN,MAX,
YOU HAVE TO DO IT FOR EACH STYLE
SEPARATELY.  THE MIN,MAX SIMPLY TELLS US
THE MINIMAL NUMBER OF INVOLVEMENT AND
MAXIMUM NUMBER OF INVOLVEMENT OF EVERY
MEMBER.  SO, LET'S LOOK AT EMPLOYEE.  WHAT
IS THE MINUTE MUM NUMBER OF INVOLVEMENT?
     STUDENT:   ONE.
     PROFESSOR:   ANYONE IN THE BACK?
YOUNG LADY?  LAST ROW.
     STUDENT:   EVERYBODY'S INVOLVED SO IT
WOULD BET HIGHEST NUMBER.
     PROFESSOR:   THE LEAST NUMBER.  I'M
LOOKING AT MIN PART.
     STUDENT:   SO IT WOULD BE ZERO.  I
DON'T KNOW.
     PROFESSOR:   ACTUALLY YOUR FIRST
ANSWER IS CORRECT, ONE.  BECAUSE THIS IS
THE MINIMUM INVOLVED.  WE WANT EVERY ONE
TO BE INVOLVED SO HE CANNOT BE NOT
INVOLVED, WHICH MEANS ONE.  HOW ABOUT THE
MAX?  HOW MANY TIMES CAN HE --
     STUDENT:   MAX.
     PROFESSOR:   WHAT?
     STUDENT:   WHATEVER MAX IS.  CAN'T
YOU WRITE MAX IN THERE?
     PROFESSOR:   HAVE YOU TO GIVE ME
EITHER A NUMBER OR INFINITY, SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.
     STUDENT:   I GO WITH INFINITY.
     PROFESSOR:   YOU'LL GO WITH INFINITY.
AND YOUR LOGIC?
     STUDENT:   EVERY EMPLOYEE HAS TO BE
WORKING ON SOMETHING.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.
     STUDENT:   AND-.
     PROFESSOR:   IT CAN WORK-.
     STUDENT:   IT CAN WORK ON --
     PROFESSOR:   SEVERAL.  THIS BIG
DIFFERENCE.  IF WE HAVE A MANY -- IF WE
INSIST EVERY EMPLOYEE HAS TO WORK ON
DIFFERENT PROJECT, THAT SHOULD BE ONE.
     STUDENT:   OTHERWISE IT'S INFINITY.
     PROFESSOR:   WE CAN WRITE INFINITY OR
IF YOU DON'T LIKE INFINITY YOU WRITE A
CAPITAL N.  THIS MEANS A BIG NUMBER HERE.
EVERYBODY SEE THAT?  BECAUSE THIS NOTATION
SOMETIMES CONFUSING BUT ACTUALLY YOU THINK
ABOUT IT'S NOT.
     STUDENT:   EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE
FINITE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES, PUTTING
INFINITY DOWN --
     PROFESSOR:   YOU WRITE A CAPITAL N
THIS MEANS THE -- THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS.
     OKAY.  HOW ABOUT THIS SIDE?  THE
PROJECT SIDE THINK ABOUT IT.  ON THE
PROJECT SIDE.  MINIMUM?
     STUDENT:   ZERO.
     PROFESSOR:   WHY?
     STUDENT:   BECAUSE THE PROJECT COULD
BE DEAD, NOBODY WORKING ON IT.
     PROFESSOR:   VERY GOOD.  IT COULD BE
AT ZERO.  THIS MEANS THE PROJECT MAY NOT
HAVE ANY EMPLOYEES WORKING ON THEM.
     THIS ONE?  TRY AGAIN?
     STUDENT:   M.
     PROFESSOR:   WHICH MEANS?
     STUDENT:   MAXIMUM NUMBER OF
EMPLOYEES WORKING ON IT.
     PROFESSOR:   CORRECT.  EVERYBODY SEE
THAT?  NOW THIS NOTATION IS GOOD IN THE
SENSE THAT IF I USE THIS NOTATION, IT
ACTUALLY COMBINES THESE TWO, OKAY?
INSTEAD OF DOING THE M, N TOTAL PARTIAL,
WE CAN USE THIS NOTATION INSTEAD.  BUT
LIKE I SAID, THE OTHER NOTATION IS MORE
INTUITIVE.  BECAUSE I CAN COME UP WITH
THAT NOTATION VERY QUICKLY.  THIS ONE I
HAVE TO THINK A LITTLE BIT.  I PRESUME YOU
ARE THE SAME WAY.  QUESTIONS?
     STUDENT:   AREN'T THOSE A LITTLE
BACKWARDS THERE?  IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU
USE THE TERM PARTIAL, YOU'RE SAYING THAT
NOT ALL PROJECTS HAVE SOMEONE WORKING ON
THEM, CORRECT?
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.
     STUDENT:   WHEN YOU'RE USING YOUR
NOTATION, YOU'RE NOT SAYING --
     PROFESSOR:   ZERO MEANS THAT IT'S NOT
PARTICIPATING.
     STUDENT:   THAT'S EMPLOYEES?
     PROFESSOR:   NO.  PROJECT.
     STUDENT:   SO THERE COULD BE ZERO
PROJECTS THAT AREN'T BEING WORKED ON FOR
MINIMUM?
     STUDENT:   THAT ARE BEING WORKED ON.
     STUDENT:   THERE COULD BE A PROJECT
THAT NOBODY'S WORKING ON.
     STUDENT:   IN OTHER WORDS, THE WORD
PARTIAL DESCRIBES HOW MANY PROJECTS ARE
BEING WORKED ON.  NOT ALL ARE BEING WORKED
ON.
     PROFESSOR:   MEANING THAT PROJECTS
MAY NOT BE PARTICIPATING.  THE PROJECT HAS
NOBODY WORKING ON IT.
     STUDENT:   SO IT'S NOT PARTICIPATING
IN THE RELATIONSHIP.
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  BUT YOUR MIN,MAX
DESCRIBES HOW MANY PROJECTS ARE
PARTICIPATING IN THE RELATIONSHIP, RIGHT?
     PROFESSOR:   ZERO PROJECT IS
PARTICIPATING.
     STUDENT:   RIGHT UP TO A MAXIMUM
OF --
     PROFESSOR:   M.  ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES
MAY BE PARTICIPATING THERE.
     STUDENT:   BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE
DESCRIBING HOW MANY PROJECTS ARE
PARTICIPATING IN THE RELATIONSHIP?
     PROFESSOR:   RIGHT.  IS TO --
     PROFESSOR:   SORRY.  SORRY.  THIS
REFER TO THE EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING.
     STUDENT:   OPPOSITE --
     PROFESSOR:   OKAY.
     STUDENT:   I GOT --
     PROFESSOR:   OKAY.  SO NOW LET'S LOOK
AT --
     STUDENT:   DO WE HAVE TO WRITE TOTAL
AND PARTIAL DOWN?
     PROFESSOR:   NO, THIS IS ALREADY
IMPLIED IN THIS LINES.  IT'S ONLY WRITING
THE SCHEMA THAT YOU NEED TO WRITE IT DOWN.
IN THE SCHEMA YOU WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN
AND YOU MAKE FOOTNOTES.  OKAY.  LIKE I
SAID, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A LARGE NUMBER
OF FOOTNOTE, JUST ENOUGH TO ILLUSTRATE THE
CONCEPT.
     SO YOU CAN EITHER DO THIS.  OR YOU
CAN USE THE MIN,MAX NOTATION WHICH IS FINE
WITH ME.  EITHER ONE WILL DO.
     OKAY.  NOW, WE CAN ALSO GO BEYOND THE
BINARY RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS VERY COMMON
IN PRACTICE TO MORE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS
AND THIS IS JUST A WARNING THAT YOU CANNOT
REPLACE A TERNARY OR HIGHER DEGREE
RELATIONSHIP BY THREE BINARY RELATIONS.
IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE NOT EQUIVALENT --
EQUIVALENT.  OF COURSE THIS IS KIND OF
OBVIOUS BECAUSE A HIGHER DIMENSION
RELATIONSHIP GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION AND
IF YOU REDUCE IT TO LOWER DIMENSION YOU
ACTUALLY LOSE INFORMATION.  SO THAT'S WHY
YOU NEED THOSE MORE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP.
OR TO PUT IT IN RELATIONAL DATABASE
CONTEXT THIS MEANS SOMETIME US YOU NEED
RELATIONS WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF DEGREE OR
MULTIPLE COLUMNS TO REPRESENT IT.  WHAT WE
ARE SEEING HERE FOR THIS EXAMPLE IS THAT
IF YOU HAVE A VERY COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP
INVOLVING INSTRUCTOR, COURSES AND
SEMESTER, YOU CANNOT EXPRESS THAT BY THREE
SMALLER TABLES.  IT JUST WILL CAUSE US TO
LOSE INFORMATION.
     OKAY.  NOW, LIKE I SAID, I WOULD LIKE
TO ADD JUST A FEW WORDS ABOUT A NEW MODEL
UML.  NOW, I KNOW MANY OF YOU ALREADY
PRINT OUT CLASS NOTES BUT IF YOU GO BACK
TO YOUR CLASS NOTES, ON ER DIAGRAM AGAIN,
AT THE VERY END I HAVE ADDED A LINK SO
THAT YOU CAN PRINT OUT MORE INFORMATION
ABOUT U-M-L.  SO CURRENTLY YOU PROBABLY
DON'T HAVE THAT.  DON'T WORRY IF YOU GO
BACK, YOU CAN PRINT IT OUT AGAIN.  NOW UML
STANDS FOR UNIFIED MODEL LANGUAGE.  WHAT
IT IS IS THAT IT IS LIKE THE NAME IMPLIES,
A ALMOST UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE
USED TO MODEL INFORMATION PROCESSING
APPLICATIONS AND IN PARTICULAR IT IS VERY
SUITABLE FOR OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN.  AND
THAT'S WHY IT'S GAINING IN POPULARITY
BECAUSE OBJECT ORIENTED APPROACHES ARE
GAINING IMPORTANCE.
     ACTUALLY, I CAN GIVE YOU A JOKE, NOT
A JOKE, IT'S TRUE.  I JUST GOT A BOOK --
YOU KNOW ONE ADVANTAGE OF BEING PROFESSOR
PEOPLE SEND YOU FREE BOOKS.  THE REASON I
ASKED FOR THIS BOOK IS THAT IT SAYS C PLUS
PLUS AND UML DESIGN, VERY FANCY TITLE,
RIGHT?  SO, I HAVE OLDER EDITION, THIS IS
NEW EDITION ON TITLE HAS BIG LETTER, UML
DESIGN.  I CHECK IT.  THE WHOLE BOOK,
AUTHOR ADDED THREE PAGES TO UML.  JUST
THREE PAGES.  AND CLAIMED THAT -- BUT
PROBABLY THIS WAY BOOST SALES.  SO I'M
DOING THE SAME THING.  I'M JUST GOING TO
TEACH A LITTLE BIT OF UML.  YOU CAN PUT ON
YOUR RESUME HAVE YOU DATABASE AND UML
DESIGN.  DON'T TELL THEM YOU LEARNED TWO
PAGES FROM ME.  IN FACT I JOKE BECAUSE
THIS IS JUST ALL YOU NEED TO USE IN TERMS
OF UML.  BECAUSE UML IS GOOD BECAUSE IT
CAN BENEFIT A COMPANY IN HAVING A NICE
INTEGRATED WAY TO DESCRIBE YOUR DESIGN
EASILY COMMUNICATED FROM THE USER, END
USER TO THE DESIGNER AND THIS WILL HELP US
TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND LOWER THE COST OF
DESIGN.  AND SOME WOULD ALSO SAY ITS SERVE
AS A SO-CALLED SOFTWARE BLUE PRINT.  YOU
ARE KNOW ENGINEER ALWAYS LIKE BLUE PRINT,
MAP OUT BLUE PRINT SO YOU CAN BASE A
DESIGN ON BLUE PRINT AND UML GIVE YOU SOME
OF THIS FLAVOR.  IN FACT YOU CAN SAY THE
SAME FOR ER DIAGRAMS.  ER DIAGRAM IS BLUE
PRINT.  ONCE HAVE YOU BLUE PRINT HAVE YOU
THE IT.  SAME THING.  SO BASICALLY WHAT I
WILL TEACH YOU IS JUST ONE DIAGRAM.  BUT
YOU'LL FIND THAT THIS IS ABOUT ALL YOU
NEED TO KNOW WHEN YOU COME UP WITH OBJECT
ORIENTED DIAGRAM.  SO, NOW, LET'S GO BACK
TO ER.  SO IN ER BASICALLY WHAT WE HAVE
ARE ENTITIES AND RELATIONS, RIGHT?  SO WE
CAPTURE CLASSES USING ENTITIES AND THEN
THEY ARE RELATED USING RELATIONSHIPS.  NOW
ER DIAGRAM CAN ACTUALLY BE EXPRESSED USING
UML AS WELL BUT UML HAS MORE EXPLICIT WAY
OF REPRESENTING CLASSES.  CLASS I DON'T
HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU ALL NOTE CONCEPT.
SO BASICALLY FOR A CLASS, WE WANT TO
EXPRESS WHAT ARE THE KEY ATTRIBUTES, THIS
PART IS COMMON WITH ER REPRESENTATION.
ENTITY REPRESENTS ATTRIBUTES AND THEN WE
WANT TO DESCRIBE HOW IT BEHAVES, IN OTHER
WORDS WHAT METHODS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE
CLASS.  NOW IN THE ER DIAGRAM WE DON'T
HAVE THAT, BECAUSE ER DIAGRAM IS NOT
OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN.
     NOW WE COME UP WITH THIS ONE.
EXAMPLE OF UML CLASS DIAGRAM IS LIKE THIS.
SO, YOU HAVE TO -- YOU HAVE THE NAME OF
THE CLASS.  YOU HAVE IT'S ATTRIBUTES.  AND
THEN YOU PUT IN A SEPARATE, ADJACENT BOX
ALL OF THE OPERATIONS.  IN ER DIAGRAM WE
DON'T HAVE THIS PART.  IN ER DIAGRAM I
JUST HAVE THE NAME OF ENTITY AND THOSE
ATTRIBUTES I DRAW THOSE ELLIPSES.  SAME
THING.  JUST SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
REPRESENTATION.  BUT THEN IN THE NEW UML
CLASS DIAGRAM, IN THIS NEW NOTATION WE
EXPLICITLY ALSO INCLUDE THE METHODS, THE
OPERATIONS.  SO HERE IS SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF
WASHING MACHINES WITH NO ATTRIBUTES.  AND
OTHER THINGS.  OKAY.  THE BASIC DIAGRAM
CAN ALSO BE COMBINED WITH DIFFERENT TYPE
OF LINKS.  I WILL JUST SHOW YOU TWO TYPES.
ONE IS THIS LITTLE DIAMOND WHICH MEANS
AGGREGATION.  AND THE BLACK DIAMOND MEANS
COMPOSITION.  COMPOSITION IS LIKE YOU KNOW
YOU COMBINED CERTAIN OBJECTS TOGETHER.
AGGREGATION IS WHEN YOU AGGREGATE OBJECT
INTO A CLASS.  THERE ARE OTHERS BUT LET ME
JUST ILLUSTRATE THIS.  OKAY.  SO THE BASIC
CLASS DIAGRAM ENABLE -- ENABLE US TO
REPRESENT A CLASS.  AND THEN THERE IS THIS
OBJECT DIAGRAM, SO I CAN USE THE VARIOUS
TYPE OF LINKS TO LINK THE OBJECT INSTANCES
TOGETHER.  FOR EXAMPLE, HERE IS
DESCRIPTION OF GAME BOARD.  A GAME WITH
BLACK AND WHITE PLAYERS, GAME HAS MOVEMENT
AND THEY ARE PIECES LIKE KING, QUEEN, ROOK
AND SO ON.  OKAY?  NOW, USING THE
COMPOSITION THIS MEANS THAT THE GAME IS
COMPOSED FROM WHITE PLAYER AND BLACK
PLAYER AND A BOARD.  THE BOARD IS AN
AGGREGATE OF SQUARES IN THE BOARD.  AND IT
AND LIKE HERE.  AND THE KING/QUEEN, THESE
ARE ALL PIECES AND THEIR AGGREGATION
DESCRIBE THE STATE OF THIS GAME.  OKAY.
SO THIS WAY YOU CAN SEE THAT UML NOTATION
FOR OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN GIVE US PRECISE
DESCRIPTION OF THE CLASSES AND INSTANCES.
SO ALL I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS THAT THERE IS
SUCH A NOTATION AND THE BASIC NOTATION FOR
CLASS DIAGRAM IS VERY EASY TO UNCTION.  IN
FACT, I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT BOOK.  THIS
IS THE ONLY THING THEY PUT IN.  BECAUSE
FROM THE PROGRAMMING POINT OF VIEW, THIS
IS ALL YOU NEED TO USE TO DESCRIBE THE C
PLUS PLUS PROGRAM.  OKAY?  SO NOW YOU CAN
SEE THE LINK BETWEEN UML AND ER DIAGRAMS.
LATER ON IF YOU HAVE MORE INTEREST, WE CAN
GO DEEPER.  BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS, KNOW
THIS TERMINOLOGY.  
SO, WE HAVE
COVERED THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF
DATABASES AND ER MODEL.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT RELATIONAL DATABASE NEXT.
