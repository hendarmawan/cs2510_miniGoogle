<center><h1>Grading Policy</h1></center>

The penalty for late submission of an assignment (such as
an exercise, a class project, a project milestone report, etc.)
is <b>one point per day</b>.  For example, if the assignment
is due on Tuesday, and you submit it on Thursday, the penalty
will be two points.
The maximum penalty is equal to the total points for this
assignment, so that your grade will not become negative.
<p>

Students are expected to attend classes.  If you are
absent from a class, you will get a one point penalty
unless you have informed the instructor before the
class and the reason for your absence is acceptable,
such as religious ceremony, family hardship, accident,
transportation problems and so on.

<p>

There will be no makeup exams.  
If you cannot take an exam due to personal illness or hardship,
you <b>must</b> inform the instructor by e-mail at least
24 hours (one day) in advance to get the instructor's approval.
For example, if the exam is scheduled on Tuesday 1pm, you
must inform the instructor by 1pm on Monday.  Except for
illness or hardship, no other reasons will be accepted.
The instructor will ask for documents as proof.  Be prepared
to submit such documentation to the instructor.
If the instructor does not approve your absence, you <b>must</b>
still take the exam.
You will receive such notice by e-mail prior to the exam, so
be prepared to check e-mail before the exam.
If you skip an exam without the instructor's prior approval,
you will receive the grade of 0 point.
<p>

If the instructor approves your absence, and the exam is the
midterm exam, your grade for the midterm exam will be 0.5
times your grade of the final exam yet to be taken.
<p>

If the instructor approves your absence, and the exam is the
final exam, your grade for the final exam will be 0.5
times your grade of the midterm exam already taken.
<p>

If you are absent from both the midterm and the final,
you will receive 0 point for both exams.
<p>

For advanced graduate courses sometimes there is no final exam.
In which case, there is always a class project.
If the instructor approves your absence, and the exam is the
midterm exam, your grade for the midterm exam will be 0.5 times
your <b>normalized</b> grade of the class project yet to be completed.
For example, the midterm is 30 points, and the class project is
40 points.  If you receive 32 points for the class project,
your midterm grade will be 0.5 x 32 x (30/40) = 12 points.

<p>
If you are absent from the midterm and fail to submit
the class project, you will receive 0 point for both.

<p>
If the instructor approves your absence, and the exam is a
quiz, your grade for the quiz will be 0.5
times your grade for the other quiz, or 0.5 times your normalized
grade for the midterm if there is only one quiz.
