<H1>Corpus-Based Discourse Analysis</H1>
<p>
The structuring of discourse into segments larger than
utterances both explains and is explained by a wide variety of
linguistic phenomena.  For example, cue phrases are words and
phrases such as ``now'' and ``that reminds me'' that may be used to
explicitly convey discourse segment structure.  However, while the
need to model the relation between discourse segments and linguistic
features of utterances is almost universally acknowledged in the
literature, there is weak consensus on the nature of
segments and the criteria for recognizing or generating them from
linguistic features.
<p>
This research concerns the development of methods for obtaining examples
of classified discourse phenomena from subjects, and the use of
machine learning and other methods to investigate the relationship
between discourse segments and linguistic phenomena.  For example, in
the area of discourse segmentation, we found that when naive subjects
performed discourse segmentation using speaker intention as the
segmentation criterion, highly significant statistical results were
obtained.  We then used the data from the subjects' segmentations as a
target for evaluating two sets of segmentation algorithms, using
information retrieval metrics.  One set of algorithms was based on
inductive machine learning. Machine learning takes as input a set of
preclassified examples coded with respect to a set of user-defined
features, and outputs an algorithm that predicts the class of any
input given its set of feature values.  To date I have used machine
learning to answer two particular questions in discourse analysis: 1)
when does a given usage of a cue word signal discourse structure, and
2) when does a segment boundary occur between two contiguous
utterances?  My results have been that both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations of a wide variety of experiments suggests that
machine learning is an effective technique for automating the
generation of algorithms for discourse analysis, as well as for
providing further insight into the data.  Furthermore, the performance
of the learned algorithms is often superior to the performance of
algorithms that have been developed manually, and approaches the
performance of human subjects.
