  <li> <b>Purpose of the course</b>
    <p>
Real-time systems are those that have timing
constraints, and that have a penalty associated with not completing
tasks by their deadlines. 
This course is intented to further the knowledge of distributed and
real-time systems development as well as specific issues in the design
of these systems. After completing this course, the student
will be able to understand and design basic real-time system software. </p>
    <p>In this seminar we will examine several scheduling and
allocation
techniques, power management issues, security problems,
real-time networks, fault tolerance issues in the design
and deployment of real-time systems, and other related issues
(covering anything that we may find interesting, nothing that we do not find interesting). </p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Pre-requisites</b>
    <p>Students are to know basic operating system principles,
such as scheduling, processes, response time, deadlocks, critical
sections (undergraduate level) and distributed systems concepts
such as sockets and basics of network protocols. </p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Grading system</b>
    <p>There will be no exams and
rarely assignments, except for reading assignments, which will be
frequent.
The grade for the course will be divided into </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>15%</strong> pop quizzes on the material to be read
weekly </li>
      <li><strong>25%</strong> presentation of 1-3 papers chosen by the
student with approval of the instructor (in a single area of interest) </li>
      <li><strong>25%</strong> class participation </li>
      <li><strong>35%</strong> project, which can be either of the
following (both options include a 5-page, 1.5 spacing, 1-inch margin,
11-pt font, written report):
        <ul>
          <li> programming project on or in a Real System </li>
          <li>simulation of a problem, with results of the simulated solution </li>
          <li>in-depth presentation of a problem, with an
analysis of shortcomings and a solution. </li>
        </ul>
This simple project has an estimated 50-60 hours total work per
student. The goal of this project is to produce a workshop-quality
paper, with the further objective of publishing a paper. Students are
welcome to coordinate projects with their fellow students (up to 2
people per group) in order to make the project more comprehensive.

  <li> <b>List of Topics</b>
    <p> </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Introduction to real-time systems </li>
      <li> Resource and application models </li>
      <li> Concepts of scheduling in real-time systems (including
multimedia) </li>
      <li> Issues and techniques in resource allocation in real-time
distributed systems </li>
      <li> Real-time I/O (including process control and multimedia) </li>
      <li> Real-time I/O (including process control and multimedia) </li>
      <li> Fault tolerance techniques for masking and recovery </li>
      <li> Other real-time related issues </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <hr></li>
  <li><b>Format of the Course</b>
    <p>This course will begin with the instructor presenting the basic
concepts of real-time systems, and relevant issues to give students a
strong background in the material. This first part of the course will
take approximately 5 weeks. In the next 10 weeks, the students will
be responsible for reading, understanding and presenting papers of
the student's election (with the help of the instructor, if desired,
with approval of the instructor in any case).
The papers presented will also be discussed in class by the class. </p>
    <p>The programming part of the course will entail understanding how
a
real system works, and familiarizing oneself with it.
Students may suggest projects, or may take projects suggested by the
instructor. Projects may be individual or in groups, depending on the
scope and length of the project.

    <p>No textbook will be required, as we will examine recent papers
published in the literature. References will be available in advance. </p>
