<blockquote>Some of the facilities provided by TeamCenter are as follows</blockquote>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
The TeamCenter JDOT Server stores its data in a SQL database specified
by the user.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
It supports the import and export of the widely used MPX file format. User
can easily move existing Microsoft Project plans into TeamCenter by using
TeamCenter's MPX Template import function. One can use TeamCenter's MPX
Template export function to export TeamCenter project plan into Microsoft
Project or any other project management tool supporting the MPX format.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
TeamCenter uses a combination of TCP ports. The first is a standard TCP
port for HTTP network traffic, specified by the user. This port is 8000
by default, but can changed to any port, including port 80, the standard
HTTP port. Through this port, the browser has access to the TeamCenter
views, 'Documents', 'Enterprise Reports' and 'Timesheet/Timesheet Approval'.
The 'Projects' view creates connections on 3 additional TCP ports. TeamCenter
Projects can be viewed through a firewall by allowing TCP traffic on the
3 consecutive ports. Database backup is only available in the JDOT Workgroup
Edition Server with the Cloudscape SQL database option.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Technical support is available through email <a href="mailto:--    support@inovie.com">support@inovie.com</a>.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
TeamNative behavior supports enhanced collaboration by enabling any number
of people to work simultaneously on the same screen, supporting editing
at the finest grain possible. All changes immediately update, so anyone
who has the same project open will see the changes as they are submitted.
There is never "user lock-out". This simultaneous access is very important?
One common scenario occurs when a manager wants to distribute schedule
maintenance responsibility among his or her team leaders. If the system
does not allow the team leaders to work on their respective areas of the
schedule simultaneously, productivity will suffer, as user lock out will
be a common occurrence.</li>
</ul>
