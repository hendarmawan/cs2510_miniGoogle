<H1>CobotDS: A Spoken Dialogue System for Chat</H1>
<p>
Traditional dialogue systems are designed to provide access to a
relatively structured and static back-end database (such as airline
reservation information), where users have well-defined, task-oriented
goals.  Compared to such systems, building a spoken dialogue system to
a chat environment is novel in many ways, and raises interesting
challenges for dialogue system design.  To explore these issues, we
have designed and implemented CobotDS (Cobot Dialogue System).
CobotDS extends ongoing work on <a href="http://cobot.research.att.com/">Cobot</a>, a software agent that resides
in a well-known internet chat server called LambdaMOO.  Founded in
1990, LambdaMOO is frequented by hundreds of users who converse with
each other using both natural language text and verbs for expressing
(in text) common real-world gestures (such as laughing, hugging,
nodding and many others).  Cobot is one of the most popular LambdaMOO
residents, and both chats with human users, and provides them with
``social statistics'' summarizing their usage of verbs and
interactions with other users (such as who they interact with, who are
the most ``popular'' users, and so on).
<p>
CobotDS provides LambdaMOO users with real-time spoken telephony
access to Cobot, and is an experiment in providing a rich social
connection between a telephone user and the text-based LambdaMOO
users.  To support conversation, CobotDS passes messages and verbs
from the phone user to LambdaMOO users (via automatic speech
recognition, or ASR), and from LambdaMOO to the phone user (via
text-to-speech, or TTS).  CobotDS also provides ``listening''
(allowing phone users to hear a description of all LambdaMOO
activity), chat summarization and filtering, personalized grammars,
and many other features.  
We hope that CobotDS will provide an
alternate means of access to LambdaMOO - either out of necessity (such
as when a user is unable to access the internet), out of a desire to
use a different input modality (speech instead of typing), or as an
entertaining accompaniment to logging on directly.  We also believe
that our experiences may hold lessons for future attempts to provide
spoken access to text systems (such as instant messaging), and more
generally for multimodal systems.
