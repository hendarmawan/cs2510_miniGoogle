techniques from traditional media, such as television and journalism, to enhance 
the presentation.&quot;</p>

<p align="center">&quot;Those who design programs for multimedia presentation and 
those who are users of multimedia presentations contribute equally to 
formulating criteria for determining guidelines or more formal requirements for 
multimedia.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="sot-7.gif" width="564" height="424"></p>

<p align="center">&quot;There are two possible approaches: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="center"><b>Slide-driven</b> - the slides are presented in sequences, 
  and the speaker talks to the slide.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="center"><b>Talk-driven</b> - the talk is given, with the occasional 
  slide to illustrate a point. </li>
</ul>
<p align="center">In the first approach the presentation opens with a slide 
giving the title for the talk. This is the <i>initial state</i> - state 0; we 
could say that the presentation is in the <b>title state.</b> The next slide is 
presented which may show the main points of the talk. This is state 1 - the talk 
is in the <b>introductory state.</b> The act of putting up a slide has by rule 
changed the talk from its title state to its introductory state. The speaker may 
now repeat the text shown on the slide and comment on it. This is an elaboration 
on state 1, and is represented as a <i>loop</i> off state 1. The last comment by 
the speaker accompanies putting up the next slide, and the talk changes to its 
next state.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here is a model of the formal structure of a newscast. The model as presented 
so far has described events occurring in sequence at one level only; but it is 
useful to capture generalizations and talk about these generalizations at 
different levels. Generalizations are related in a hierarchy - the most abstract 
down to particular events - the actual events that occur in the real world. A 
tree structure describes these relations. </p>
<p>The formal approach can be applied at any level in the hierarchy; the 
formalisms will apply at each level. For example, level 3 in the diagram may be 
described by the following: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>State 0 is the initial state, the title of the news program. Note that the 
  actual title as it appears in Level 4 can be different each time. Level 3 is 
  concerned with the <i>idea</i> of a title, an abstract title. The title may 
  also include sound. </p>
  <p>A transition to state 1 results in a video of a news reader. A final 
  statement from the reader initializes state 2. As with the title, the idea of a 
  formal statement will be there on each occasion, although the statement itself 
  - its <i>instantiation</i> - will vary. State 2 is a video of the event 
  reported in state 1; a transition to state 3 of a still, accompanied by voiceover, initializes state 4. </p>
  <p>The transition to expert opinion on the event in state 3 may be accompanied 
  by another opinion or comment. This is a loop off of state 4. A transition to 
  state 5 brings a reader back to screen and a new news item. </p>
  <p>A final statement by the reader initializes state 6; a still, and a 
  voiceover initialize state 7, the exit or 'outro' of the program. This itself 
  can introduce another program, such as weather, or ads, which will itself be 
  initially in state 0. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The description here is of a level in the program, not the state sequence of 
the reader, the video or the cameras. Each of these may have their own state 
model equivalent to the appropriate scripts as written for media productions.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Genre</b> </p>
<p>When considering media, several types of program are defined, called <b>
genres</b>. There are about six major categories of genre: news, documentary, 
soap opera, quiz, drama, and some types of program that fall into two 
categories, e.g. 'docudrama'. Various descriptive terms can be assigned to 
define the genres: such as repetition, circularity, openendedness, etc. Restated 
in formal terms, these descriptions are seen as metarules - general conditions 
which define genre in the same way metarules define flora and fauna in biology.
</p>
<p><b>Descriptive terms</b> </p>
<p>There are a number of these terms; the following are a selection which can be 
used informally for defining useful genre types for multimedia. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Repetition</b> The elements that define a particular show are repeated 
  and reinforced during the time the show is running. Formats are repetitive; 
  for example, a newscast covers what is happening in the world at the moment, a 
  police drama always covers crime. </p>
  <p><b>Novelty</b> Accomapnies repetition, otherwise the viewer becomes bored. 
  A new problem must be presented each time; e.g. in news, there must be new 
  events or disasters, human interest, etc. </p>
  <p><b>Opnendedness</b> Unresolved problems with future solutions. </p>
  <p><b>Immediacy</b> Gives the audience the sense of being in the action, of 
  finding a resolution to problem presented earlier. </p>
  <p><b>Segmentation</b> Multiple events, multiple stories which weave together 
  as in a drama. Also refers to different types of media objects - video clips, 
  stills, talking heads, etc. </p>
  <p><b>Metarules</b> </p>
  <p>The above relatively informal descriptions of the occurrence of particular 
  parameters can be reformulated as rules for defining particular genres (Level 
  1 in <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/speech/pubs/presents/sot-93/sot-10.html">
  slide 10</a>): </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If news, then immediacy AND opendedness AND repetition AND segmentation 
    AND novelty.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>If drama, then immediacy AND repetition AND segmentation AND 
    (optionally) repetition.
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>If documentary, then segmentaiton AND (optionally) openendedness AND 
    (optionally) repetition. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Subrules</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>if immediacy, then include alphabet objects to enable audience 
    involvement; </li>
    <li>if openendedness, then final state to include (at least one) unresolved 
    issue; </li>
    <li>if repetition, then a 'feature' to re-occur (e.g. format, transmission 
    time, etc.). </li>
    <li>if segmentation, then 'story' to be multi-stranded; </li>
    <li>if novelty, then unexpected elements to be included. </li>
  </ul>
