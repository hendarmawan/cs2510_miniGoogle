<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The formal models that I’ve discussed are useful for 
generating a static presentation based on existing properties of the items in 
the multimedia database (i.e. the parameters must be known at the time we are 
generating the presentation.)&nbsp; The web portal must deal with different 
issues, specifically managing and presenting dynamic content in an effective 
manner without need for explicit presentation parameters.&nbsp; The content is 
usually text based, but there is nothing preventing the administrator from 
integrating video and sound.</p>

  <li>A web portal is an integrated software system that allows the web site 
  designer ease of deploying HTML indexed multimedia content.&nbsp; This can be 
  done with very basic knowledge of HTML - don't need to know how to &quot;program&quot; 
  to add content.</li>
  <li>Usually the concept of a &quot;story&quot; is used as the building blocks.&nbsp; 
  Each story is posted by the administrator or a user with the appropriate 
  rights.</li>
  <li>Stories can be submitted by anybody, but will not be displayed - they will 
  be queued until an admin approves them.</li>
  <li>Public threads for discussion available, as well as a user feedback system 
  for filtering content.</li>
  <li>Allows truly distributed multimedia by automatically pulling scheduled XML 
  feeds from other web sites.</li>
  <li>Allows customization of content - skinning, languages, filtering</li>
</ul>
