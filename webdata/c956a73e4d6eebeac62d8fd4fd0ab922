          <h2>Welcome!</h2>
          <p>My name is Adam Hobaugh. I am the Tech Coordinator, a member of the Webteam and the primary web developer for the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh.</p> 
          <p>Each member of the CS Department receives some webspace when they get their accounts. I debated for a while on what to put here. Should it be all work? Should it be all play? Well, we all know what they say about devoting something to one thing. So, I decided I would do a little of each.</p>

              <p>Now for the fun. Outside of work, I have some very non-technical interests. The first of which is permaculture. Some links for permaculture are.

              <p>I am also an active member in the Pittsburgh Pagan Community. When I was a student, I had no idea that Pittsburgh had a pagan community, let alone anyone other than me at Pitt. If you are a pagan student and feel that you are alone at Pitt, please feel free to contact me and I can put you in contact with the community.</p>
