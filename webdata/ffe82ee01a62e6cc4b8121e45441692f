 <h2>What is  a Software Component??</h2>

<h2>In software-speak, a <font color=blue>"component"</font> is a discreet 
package of computer code that  performs services. In essence, components enable the software developer to build 
software that is made up of replaceable parts. Changes to the software can be 
made with less worry of implications to the overall code base -- you can change 
the code in the component, or completely replace the component without affecting 
the rest of the code base. The software developer may also purchase pre-built 
components from an external source and 'plug' them into their program.
