<h3>In 1981 Dr. Chang wrote a science fiction
short story, <a href="fiction/nocturne.pdf">Nocturne</a>,
which was published on February 17, 1981 in
a Chinese newspaper in Taiwan - the United Daily News.
Nocturne (translated from the Chinese by John Balcom) is really a love story disguised as
science fiction.  However in this short story
Dr. Chang first introduced the Chronobot - a device
for the exchange of time.
<br><br>
When Dr. Chang went on sabbatical in 2004, he
was invited by Industry Technology Research Institute (ITRI)
in Taiwan to initiate an advanced research project.
Therefore he decided to turn the Chronobot from
concept into reality.
<br><br>
On July 21, 2004 Dr. Chang announced the publication of
his 3D book of short stories <i><a href="R.htm">City Hunter</a></i> and initiation of the <a href="http://chronobot.itri.org.tw/eng/index.html">Chronobot project</a>
(see also the <a href="http://chronobot.itri.org.tw">Chinese website</a>)
<br><br>
On November 2, 2010, Dr. Chang received approval from US Patent Office for Patent <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7827067.html">US7827067</a> with the title, "Device
and method for time and knowledge exchange
and management".  This patent is based upon
his science fiction short story written almost
thirty years ago.  Now it is turned into
a patent, maybe a commercial device one day.
