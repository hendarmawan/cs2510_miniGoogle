<H1>The Smart Image System (Patent US5974201 issued Oct 26, 1999)</H1>
<p>
A smart image is an image plus the associated knowledge structure.
It is a unique technology developed jointly by researchers from
the University of Pittsburgh and Siemens Corporate Research.
<p>
Why we need smart images? Because images require knowledge to
be interpreted correctly.  Image operations are often time-consuming
and must be explicitly requested in existing systems.  In the
smart image system, the smart image is capable of performing
actions by itself.  It can also provide more information to the user.
The concept is similar to a Smart House.
<p>
In what follows, we present an example, using medical image
information systems as the potential application.  Other
applications include the intelligent factory, the intelligent
office, the service engineer's assistant, and active image
information management.
<p>
<p>
<a href="images/frame01.gif">  Frame #1 </a>  Initial frame for the smart image system, showing
   the medical information system application example.
   For this smart image application, the system will allow the
   doctor to examine the image data for the patients.
<p>
<a href="images/frame02.gif">  Frame #2 </a>  First, the user can select the name of the physician.
<p>
<a href="images/frame03.gif">  Frame #3 </a>  Then, the user enters the password.
<p>
<a href="images/frame04.gif">  Frame #4 </a>  Once the physician is selected,  his name appears
   in the upperleft area of the smart image frame.
<p>
<a href="images/frame05.gif">  Frame #5 </a>  The patients are displayed, for the user to select.
<p>
<a href="images/frame06.gif">  Frame #6 </a>  The selected patient is highlighted.
<p>
<a href="images/frame07.gif">  Frame #7 </a>  The patient information is displayed in the upperleft
   area of the smart image frame.
<p>
<a href="images/frame08.gif">  Frame #8 </a>  One of the main purposes of the smart image is to predict
   the user's intention.  When the smart image is capable
   of predicting some action, such action will be performed
   as a background process.  The background window is
   the light green window on the right hand side.  We show
   this window to illustrate the smart image capability.
   Normally, this window need not be shown.
<p>
<a href="images/frame09.gif">  Frame #9 </a>  The examination window is shown.  Now the physician can
   select a particular type of examination that is available.
<p>
<a href="images/frame10.gif"> Frame #10 </a>  For example, the physician selected the most recent
    MUGA study.
<p>
<a href="images/frame11.gif"> Frame #11 </a>  Since the physician will most likely also examine the
    previous MUGA studies, in the background process the
    system prefetches these images from the PACS, as shown
    by the two iconic images in the background window.
<p>
<a href="images/frame12.gif"> Frame #12 </a>  The current image is retrieved first and displayed.
<p>
<a href="images/frame13.gif"> Frame #13 </a>  Once a background image prefetching task is complete,
    that icon disappears.
<p>
<a href="images/frame14.gif"> Frame #14 </a>  The background prefetching task is complete for both
    studies, therefore both icons disappear.
<p>
<a href="images/frame15.gif"> Frame #15 </a>  We close the background window.  Now the physician is
    examining the current MUGA image.  He can define hotspots
    to be associated with a smart image.  For example, the
    current MUGA image already has some associated hotspots.
<p>
<a href="images/frame16.gif"> Frame #16 </a>  Again, to illustrate the smart image concept, we will
    bring up the POSTQUEL window, and show a database
    query to retrieve the information associated with
    the smart image from the database.
<p>
<a href="images/frame17.gif"> Frame #17 </a>  In the database window, three previously created hotspots
    are shown.  For each hotspot instance, we can show the image
    it is associated with, the hotspot type (in this case it
    is type 10), the region of interest ROI (255,255,0,0), and
    the agent(s) that created these hotspots (in this case,
    the hotspots were created by the protocol automatically).
<p>
<a href="images/frame18.gif"> Frame #18 </a>  The protocol is the user model for a physician to examine
    the patient.  The different states reflect the different
    tasks the physician want to perform.  For example, we are
    currently at the state "identify abnormalities", shown in
    red.
<p>
<a href="images/frame19.gif"> Frame #19 </a>  Now if the physician introduces a new hotspot, it will
    activate a hotspot rule, leading to the performing of
    some actions and the change of protocol state.
<p>
<a href="images/frame20.gif"> Frame #20 </a>  The protocol state now changes to "time domain study".
    It is shown in red.
<p>
<a href="images/frame21.gif"> Frame #21 </a>  Now if we examine the contents of the database, three new
    hotspots have been created.  The first one is created for the
    current image under examination.  Therefore,  its creator is
    the user.  The other two hotspots are created by the smart
    image system, by propagating the hotspots to images of the
    same type in previous studies.  Therefore, the creator is
    "propagate".   This illustrates the smart image can automatically
    add knowledge to itself, i.e. the hotspots can be created and
    propagated to other images.  The hotspots enable the smart image
    to automatically react to certain events, such as the presence
    of a tumor in a medical image.
<p>
<a href="images/frame22.gif"> Frame #22 </a>  The physician now finishes the study.  He can record his findings
    in the diagnosis report, and suggests a treatment plan.  The smart
    image system has the capability to allow the user to add text
    information (as shown in the next frame), or voice recording,
    or links to other studies.  So it is also a powerful multimedia
    or hypermedia system.
<p>
<a href="images/frame23.gif"> Frame #23 </a>  The text information on the diagnosis report and recommendation
    is illustrated. For example, the report may say the following:
	|NMR images examined. Ischemia (heart wall muscle damage)|
	|due to a stenosis (full or partial block in a vein).    |
	|Recommend a cardiac angiogram be performed.             |
<p>
<a href="images/frame24.gif"> Frame #24 </a>  We return to the main smart image frame.
<p>
<a href="images/frame25.gif"> Frame #25 </a>  Now the physician can send the smart images to other physicians.
    The purple "Imail Utility" window allows the user to select the
    receiver's name, and the name of the smart image to be sent.
<p>
<a href="images/frame26.gif"> Frame #26 </a>  The smart image is transmitted progressively, so that the important
    area (such as the region of interest in the hotspot) will be
    transmitted and displayed in full resolution, and the background
    area will become clearer and clearer as time goes by.
<p>
The above demo has illustrated some of the important characteristics of the
smart image.  First, it is capable of performing operations by
itself, such as the prefetching of images.  Second, it is capable
of adding knowledge by itself, such as the propagation of hot spots.
Third, it is capable of reacting to an event, such as the triggering
of a hotspot rule.  Fourth, all kinds of information, including
text, audio, video, graphics, can be appended to a smart image.
Finally, the smart image knows how to transmit itself in the
most efficient and economical manner.  The University of Pittsburgh and
Siemens team is now exploring new ways of applying the smart images.
