<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="5">Estimated that up to 30 percent of the 
  effort in writing component based software is spent writing object 
  housekeeping software</font></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="5">COM+ will handle this task for developers by 
  providing implementations of most of the code which deals with the object 
  infrastructure, leaving the developer free to write logic which deals with the 
  problem they are trying to solve</font></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="5">A developer in a COM+ world will usually 
  just provide the Meta data which is needed and provide the methods. Most of 
  the other code dealing with things such as registering components, reference 
  counting for memory management etc. will be handled by the system<br>
  <br>
</font></li>
</ul>
