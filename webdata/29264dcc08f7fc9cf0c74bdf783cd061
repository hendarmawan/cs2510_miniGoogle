<h2>Abstract</h2>
</center>
To accomplish the retrieval, discovery and fusion of medical information from diverse sources, 
an active medical information system capable of
retrieving, processing and filtering medical information, checking for
semantic consistency, and structuring the relevant information for distribution is needed.
We describe a framework for the human- and
system-directed retrieval, discovery and fusion of medical information, which
is based upon the observation that a significant
event often manifests itself in different media over time.
Therefore if we can index such manifestations and dynamically
link them, then we can check for consistency and discover important and relevant medical information.

This dynamic indexing technique is based upon
the theory of active index.
A powerful newly developed artificial neural network is used for
the discovery of significant events.
An experimental systemis implemented for further empirical research.  A
