The Cookie Technology</h1></center>

<p><b>Some scenarios first:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Alice is shopping at a particular web site that uses a shopping cart
metaphor.&nbsp; She puts items into a shopping cart by clicking a link
or an "Add to Shopping Cart" button.&nbsp; Cookies can be used to store
the contents of Alice's shopping cart so that she can conveniently purchase
a cart full of items rather than one item at a time.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Bob fills out a web form with his name, address, and other information.&nbsp;
Cookies can be used to store this information so that the next time Bob
visits the site, the information is automatically uploaded and he doesn't
have to provide it again.&nbsp; If the form contains sensitive information
such as a credit card number or a mailing address, the cookies can be delivered
over Security Sockets Layer, which encrypts the information as it travels
between the client and server.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Carl clicks around a web site that allows users to specify their interested
fields.&nbsp; Cookies can be used to store information about which categories
he has chosen so that the next time Carl visits the site, only those chosen
categories are displayed.</b></li>
</ul>
