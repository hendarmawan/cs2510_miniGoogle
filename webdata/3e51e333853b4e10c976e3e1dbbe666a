I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of
Pittsburgh, as of January 2015.
<br><br>

In Fall 2015, I am teaching <a href="http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/cs1699">
CS1699: Introduction to Computer Vision</a>.
<br><br>

I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin, in August 2014. My adviser was <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman">Kristen Grauman</a>. My research interests lie in computer vision (specifically attribute-based recognition, image retrieval, human-machine communication for improved recognition, and exploring the interactions between vision and language), machine learning, and crowdsourcing. I got my undergraduate degree at Pomona College in California, with majors in Computer Science and Media Studies.
<br><br>

I am the chair of the CVPR 2016 Doctoral Consortium, area chair for WACV 2016, and senior program committee member for IJCAI 2016. 
At CVPR 2015, I co-organized the <a
href="https://sites.google.com/site/wicv2015/home">WiCV 2015: Women in
Computer Vision</a> workshop. At ECCV 2014, I co-organized a workshop on <a href="http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/hmcv2014/">Human-Machine Communication for Visual Recognition and Search</a>.
