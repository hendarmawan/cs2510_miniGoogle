<h3 class="title">Lecture 19</h3>
<p> This class focuses on another common type of Bayesian Networks,
called Hidden Markov Models. These are good for modeling domains that
involve sequences. Here is a

<h3 class="title">Lecture 16/17</h3>
<p> This week we began our discussion on Bayesian networks. We talked
about the importance of conditional independence in modeling complex
events. We talked about ways of constructing a Bayesian network from
available information, and we talked about perform inferences using a
completed Bayesian network. Here is a

<p> Reminder: your preliminary assignment is due tonight. You must
make an attempt at submitting using the submission webform before
11:59pm. If things went smoothly, you've satisfied the preliminary
requirement; otherwise, you need to work out the issues by next Monday
(9/14).

<p> Python: If you are not familiar with Python, you should have
already begun to work through some tutorials. Here are some <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r0ZVlCU68pVJI3hViTS-Dsiz6x4lwEpParZwke-P-Cs/edit?usp=sharing">suggested
