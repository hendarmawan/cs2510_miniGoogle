<h1 align="center">An OPEN process for CBD</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="5">&quot;Creating applications from preexisting components is a
  necessary part of any CBD process.&nbsp; The emphasis shifts from synthesis
  with OO to integration with CBD to a prominence on creating these components
  as reusable assets.&quot;&nbsp; We can use existing development processes for
  OOD with modifications suitable for CBD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="5"><u>Definition</u>: A <b>process</b><font color="#FF0000">
  </font>is a &quot;set of interrelated activities, which transform inputs into
  outputs&quot; (ISO, 1995).&nbsp; It discusses what must be done, by whom,
  when, and how.&nbsp; It assists both the development and
  management teams in creating a software-intensive system in an orderly manner
  to maximize the chances for an on-time delivery and a quality of product.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="5"><u>Definition</u>: <b>OPEN</b><font color="#FF0000">
  </font>
  stands for <b>Object-oriented Process, Environment and Notation</b>. It is a
  series of best practices that may be implemented as needed to improve the
  component-based software process and its quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font size="5">OPEN provides a suite of tasks and techniques which can be
  tailored <i>specifically</i> to each individual project. OPEN provides strong
  support for <font color="#0000FF">process modeling </font> and <font color="#0000FF">requirements
  engineering</font> <font color="#FF0000"> </font>and has an embedded <font color="#0000FF">project
  management </font> and <font color="#0000FF">reuse</font> framework. It
  supports <font color="#0000FF">business process modeling</font>, offers
  guidelines on <font color="#0000FF">migration strategies</font> and supports
  links to <font color="#0000FF">human relations issues</font>. </font></p>

<h3>Hint: For a concrete example, think about how you would design a
five-course dinner: appetizer, first course, second course, third course, dessert.  Consider the decisions to be made at each level, how to select the ingredients from available sources, and how would the OPEN approach be applied.</h3>
