<h1>Incremental Specification</h1>
</center>

<h3>
The incremental specifications must be consistent,
so that they can be synthesized into an integrated
solution.
<p>
We need to verify that the incremental specifications
are consistent, by checking (a) the C-cards are
consistent,  (b) the I-cards are consistent,
and (c) the cards can be integrated.

<p>
(a) Two C-cards are consistent, if either (i) the node names
and arc names are disjoint, or (ii) the node names
and arc names are not disjoint, and the overlapped
sub-nets are identical.
