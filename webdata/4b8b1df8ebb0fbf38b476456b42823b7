<h2>Alternative payment model</h2>

<p><font size="4">Businesses now have open to them another
payment model for its applications. Rather than try to convince
users to buy an expensive software package, most of which they
don't need, it can modularize it and customize the modules to
customers' needs. This not only reduces costs but increases their
reputation of their service and sales department.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Being able to rent out software functionality
can also provide a steady income stream for smaller businesses -
this is part of the reason why &quot;pay-for-play&quot;
multiplayer is common in some games. Rental can also be
attractive for their customers, in the same way computer rental
is becoming popular. Rather than have to shell out a large amount
of money for major upgrades and throw away the older software,
they can merely rent it for as long as needed, and upgrade at a
relatively lower cost. For small businesses that can't afford
large expenditures, renting software in small, regular payments
might be more practical from a budget standpoint.</font></p>
