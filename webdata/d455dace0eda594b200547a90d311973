</CENTER>
<P>
<h4>HIPR2 contains many useful tutorials. These are contained in static web pages, 
  which are VERY informational, as well as interactive JAVA applets which will 
  be described later, by Stephen Hughes. The worksheet overview is: <a href="http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/HIPR2/format.htm">How 
  to Use the Worksheets</a>. Generally, there are nine categories of important 
  image processing operations. Within each category, they are arranged in order 
  of increasing difficulty. Each operation has these parts: Common name (and alternatives), 
  Brief Description, How it Works, Guidelines for Use (with Imagelinks, which 
  expand to full size pictures), Common Variants, Exercises (using the <a href="http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/HIPR2/images.htm">Image 
  Library</a>!), References, and Local Information (directions for your own local 
  copy). Beyond this, difficult concepts may be cross-referenced to other files 
  or supported by the glossary (<a href="http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/HIPR2/glossary.htm">The 
  A to Z</a>) or <a href="http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/HIPR2/biblio.htm">bibliography</a>.</H4>
