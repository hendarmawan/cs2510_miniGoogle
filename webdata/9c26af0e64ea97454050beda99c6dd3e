The temperature sensor is a key component in SIS Healthcare system. By design, 
it provides the functionalities that can be applied to measure, store and report 
temperatures to SIS server and thereafter other components in SIS Healthcare 
system. The implementation of Temperature functionalities includes three aspects: 
stand-alone Temperature Component, temperature setting menu in GUI and 
SIS messages that involves Temperature Component and other components in 
SIS Healthcare system.

This "readme" file descriptions of how to run the Temperature Component is given. 
A user can follow the instructions to start the component and have it report 
temperature measurements to GUI, schedule a start and/or end time of 
measurement, send out alert if a certain temperature threshold is reached and 
select what content is included in the alert.

User Menu:

(1) Before start any program execution, please make sure that there is no running 
"TEMPerV21.exe" in your processes, and unplugging and re-plugging the physical 
temperature sensor to PC.

(2) Go to "\PersonalHealthcare2014_v5\PersonalHealthcare2014\Components", you 
can find a "init.bat". 

(3) Double click it then wait for all windows popping out and components initiated.

(4) To have temperature component working, go to the window of GUI and click the 
check-box of "TEMP". 

(5) Select/type-in the parameters for the temperature component before clicking 
"OK". If you have any problem in getting to this point, please contact Jerry at 
zichuan@pitt.edu.

(6) Now everything should be set up and ready to go. Click "View" in the GUI. Real-
time temperature readings will appear on your GUI panel at the given rate that you 
set up earlier in the "temperature set-up" window. If you have a preferred start/end 
time for running the component, it will start and end at your given time accordingly.

(7) If a certain temperature threshold is reached (high or low bound), an email is sent 
out to the address as of your input in GUI panel. The default email address for testing 
is "zichuan@pitt.edu". You may use your own email instead. If you have any problem 
sending email to your own email address, please contact Jerry at zichuan@pitt.edu.
