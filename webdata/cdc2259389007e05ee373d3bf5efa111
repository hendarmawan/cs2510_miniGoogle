The International Journal of Distance Education Technologies (JDET) publishes original research 
articles of distance education four issues per year. JDET is the primary forum for researchers and 
practitioners to disseminate practical solutions to the automation of open and distance learning. The 
journal is for academic researchers and engineers who work on distance learning programs and 
software systems, as well as educators and general participants of distance education.
The journal covers practical solutions, especially automatic technologies of distance learning. 
Educational methodologies and theory are less emphasized. The purpose of JDET is to combine 
communication mechanisms, intelligent methods, and educational technologies in the use of distance 
education. Discussions of computational methods, algorithms, implemented prototype systems, and 
applications of open and distance learning are the focuses. Practical experiences and surveys of using 
distance learning systems are also welcome. Distance education technologies published in JDET will 
be divided into the following three categories:
<p>
<li><b>Communication Technologies</b> include new network infrastructures, real-time protocols, 
broadband and wireless communication tools, Quality-of-Services issues, multimedia streaming 
technology, distributed systems, mobile systems, multimedia synchronization controls, and other 
technologies of distance education.
<li><b>Intelligent Technologies</b> include intelligent tutoring, individualized distance learning, neural 
network or statistical approaches to behavior analysis, automatic FAQ reply methods, copyright 
protection and authentication mechanisms, soft computing, visual computing, and other 
technologies of distance education.
<li><b>Educational Technologies</b> include practical and new learning models, automatic assessment 
methods, effective and efficient authoring systems, and other issues of distance education.

<h2>Paper Submission and Evaluation</h2>

	All submissions and evaluations are processed electronically. However, accepted manuscripts 
and copyright forms will be sent the publisher for publication. The publisher will publish the journal in 
both print and electronic formats. For paper submission, please visit the following Web site: 
http://www.mine.tku.edu.tw/JDET. For questions regarding the submission and review status, please 
send e-mail or write to: 
<p>
Timothy K. Shih, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Tamkang University, 151 Ying-Chuan Road, Tamsui, Taipei Hsien, Taiwan 25137, R.O.C. <b>E-mail</b>: tshih@cs.tku.edu.tw  <b>Fax</b>: + 886 2 26209749  <b>Tel</b>: + 886 2 26215656 x2743, x2616

<h2>Special Issue Proposal</h2>
JDET publishes special issues on the recent trends in distance education technologies. A short 
proposal containing the title of proposed special issue, tentative list of invited authors, suggested date of 
publication and a call-for-papers should be sent to Professor Chang (chang@cs.pitt.edu) for review.

<h2>Call for Reviewers</h2>

	JDET is looking for people to serve on the Board of Reviewers who will be acknowledged in 
the journal annually. Each reviewer receives at most three papers per year to review. If you are 
interested in serving as a reviewer, please choose one of the above three areas and send your 
curriculum vitae, or the URL of your Web site, via e-mail to Professor Shih (tshih@cs.tku.edu.tw).
