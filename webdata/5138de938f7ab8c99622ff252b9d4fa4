<li>
<b>Cookies were first introduced in Netscape Navigator 1.0, which was released
in 1994.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>The State Management subworking group of the Internet Engineering Task
Force's HTTP Working Group is currently working on creating a formal internet
draft for a cookie specification.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Now all major browsers support the use of cookies.&nbsp; Many scripting
languages for the web use the cookie as their underlying mechanism for
preservation of session states.</b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>According to Netscape's cookie specification, cookies are named as such
"for no compelling reason".&nbsp; However, the term <i>cookie</i> isn't
uncommon in the computer science community.&nbsp; It's usually used when
referring to a piece of data held by an intermediary agent for later retrieval.&nbsp;
This description fits the use of the term within the web community.</b></li>
