<h2>A Simple Example to test your IC Manager Environment</h2>

The example included in the icm.zip package contains six files:

<pre>
ic.dat test.in sclick.c dclick.c index.html ic_mng.exe
</pre>

The IC <a href="icmic.in">test.in</a> has two state: 0 and 1.
In 0, it receives an input msg SINGLECLICK, goes to
state 1 and performs action singleclick().
In 1, it receives an input msg DOUBLECLICK, returns to
state 0 and performs action doubleclick().

<p>
The files <a href="icmic.dat">ic.dat</a> and test.ic should be copied into the directory where the
icm .c and .h files are stored.
The two c programs: sclick.c and dclick.c, should be created by the user, in which two
actions are defined.

<p>
Run "icc ic.dat" in dos prompt.
Finally open VC++, make a new project and add the following files into
the project:

<pre>
actions.c  app.h  cgienv.c db_def.h
do_predicate.c event_mesg.h fuzzy.c
fuzzy.h  ic.h  ic_func2.c  ic_func3.c
ic_functions.c   ic_state.c  icm.c
util.c mm.h  prototype.h

</pre>
The project is then compiled.

<p>
After setting up the virtual directory in the personal web server,
you can test the example by browsing index.html.
