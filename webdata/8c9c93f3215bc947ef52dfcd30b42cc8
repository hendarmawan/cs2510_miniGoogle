<h2>
<b>
IC cards can be decomposed to separate ORGANIC
and INORGANIC activities:
<font color=red>
An organic activity is one that involves
human interaction;
an inorganic activity is one that does not
involve human interaction.
</font>
<br><br>
Inorganic activities can be scheduled first because
they do not need to wait for human interaction.
On the other hand, organic activities can be scheduled
later because waiting may be necessary.
