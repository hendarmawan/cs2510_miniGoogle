He cut off a slice of his Life and tossed it into the
hearth in front of her just as he did every night. As the
bits and pieces of his Life blazed in the fire, he took the
opportunity to ask her in earnest, "Please! Tell me another
story."<p>
She smiled and let him hold her hand softly. "What do
you want to hear?"<p>
"Tell me again about the time we were in the park."<p>
    "You've forgotten. We will never repeat the same story."
<p>
    He had really forgotten. However, she began to stir the
fire obediently...and then they returned to the park. He was
nine and she was seven. They sat by a pond which was covered
with a layer of thin mist. A lotus flower bloomed in the
middle. And from another corner of the pond came the sounds
of oars mixed with singing. He gazed at the red blossom; the
flower suddenly changed into a pulsating flame.
<p>
    "That's it?" he said disappointedly. "That was too
short."
<p>
    "I've told you already. We will never repeat the same
story."
<p>
    "I can't remember clearly, but our story can't possibly
be that short."
<p>
    She didn't say anything, but drooped her head. The fire
had already died out, and the remnants of his Life turned
into black, broken embers. He looked at her silver-gray hair
and could not help being sullen.
<p>
<br>   
<p>
    The next evening he came back again, cut off a thick
slice of Life, and tossed it into the hearth. She reached
out but was unable to stop him, and couldn't hold back her
anger.
<p>
    "You shouldn't do that. After all, it is your Life."
<p>
    "That's right. It's my Life and I can do anything I
want." He examined the wax figure in his hand. An arm and a
leg were already gone.
<p>
    "My Life," he groaned coolly, "is nothing but a wax
figure -- it's all superstition. Let me tell you how this
superstition came about. When our great, great grandparents
were still traveling in space, everyone had to carry a small
wax figure. Actually it wasn't a wax figure, but a piece of
condensed, solid fuel. Just in case of an accident, they
could insert it into the mini-reactor of their life-support
suit. This way they would be able to survive for ten more
days in space while waiting for rescue. They called this wax
figure `Life', and we just inherited this superstition."
<p>
    His vision became blurred when he stored away the badly
maimed figure. "Please tell me another story. Tell me a long
story, a long, long story."
<p>
    She sighed and obediently stirred the fire...and they
returned to a small hut by the sea. He was nineteen and she
was seventeen. He hugged her tightly and kissed her soft,
black hair. She enjoyed rubbing her cheek on his short
beard, and then gave him a mystifying smile.
<p>
    "Why do you look at me like that?"
<p>
    "Lend me your ear and I'll tell you."
<p>
    He did what she asked. She nibbled his earlobe lightly
and said, "I love you."
<p>
    They stood close by the window, listening to the
perpetual sound of the waves. The moonlight bathed her naked
shoulders, making her skin look slightly blue and her form
slim and attractive. (It is said that moonlight can make
people go crazy.) He kissed her again and again, then lifted
his head and gazed at the moon. Gradually, the jadelike disk
began to dissolve into a radiant orange light. He groaned
painfully.
<p>
    "No! Don't do that. You clearly promised me a long, long
story."
<p>
    "I can't. I have tried my best to stretch the story out,
but each time it's just shorter than the last. I don't
understand why myself."
<p>
    As the fire died out, the room cooled down immediately.
The biting cold penetrated deep into his soul. He could
stand no more, gritted his teeth and pulled out the wax
figure, but she grasped his knife-yielding hand just in
time.
<p>
    "That's enough! Winter's still long."
<p>
    "Anyway, this is the last winter, so you don't have to
worry about me."
<p>
    "I said enough is enough." She argued with him for a
while, then changed her tone and cajoled him, "If you behave
yourself, I'll let you listen to another story. I can tell a
story even if there's no fire."
<p>
    "Really? I don't believe it."
<p>
    "If you behave, I'll start." Then she did start telling
another story about a far-off city that was covered with
snow and ice the whole year long. There people were always
hiding in huge, windowless cylindrical buildings, and
workers moved in the subterranean tunnels like ants going
back and forth day and night.
<p>
    "I don't want to listen any more. How can you remember
so clearly?"
<p>
    "Because it's not imagined. Don't you remember? Didn't
you always say that if you could just leave that city you'd
be satisfied and wouldn't want anything more?"
<p>
    But he did not remember, or maybe he did not want to
remember. She continued to talk about a spring-like city
where flowers bloomed everywhere, the sunlight was bright
and everlasting, and the people sang and danced all around.
<p>
    "You said once you got to the Spring City, then you'd be
happy. But in the end you still weren't."
<p>
    "And after that?"
<p>
    "After that you left me and followed her."
<p>
    "Followed whom? I've completely forgotten."
<p>
    He really didn't remember, he had forgotten everything.
There was only one way. He started rubbing the wax figure in
his pocket. It seemed that she had figured him out and said
coldly, "Don't bother, I'll tell you...After that you again
returned to my side, and then again you went off for another
woman. Then you came back again. After that you became old.
After that we left the city and moved here."
<p>
    "Why? I really don't understand. How could I be so
foolish?"
<p>
She shrugged her shoulders. "You've lost all your
imagination, but it's not my fault."
<p>
It was getting colder and colder. Knowing that she
wouldn't tell any other stories, he stood up and left. The
woman did not say anything, just sat quietly in front of the
extinguished fire.
<p>
<br>   
<p>
    Dreamless nights were an ordeal for him. He tried his
best to recall the people she talked about in her stories,
but they were reluctant to form clear images in his mind.
Did he really meet other women? She said there were two, but
he hardly had any recollection. She said it's all in his
imagination. However, he often doubted that they even
existed there; maybe she was just making them up in her
stories in order to hurt him. Actually he only liked to
listen to stories about the two of them -- in the park when
he was nine and she was seven. But each time she told the
story the contents were different. Sometimes it seemed that
they were sitting by the pond; sometimes they were swinging
in a swing. The worst was that he always forgot the contents
of her previous story. Perhaps she was only repeating five
or six different park stories, instead of what she claimed
-- that the contents were completely different each time.
But he also had no way to prove it.
<p>
    One day he was astonished to realize that he had
forgotten even his own name! This was a new blow. He had no
choice but to ask the woman. She replied indifferently,
"Does it matter? There are only the two of us here."
<p>
    "But, how could I live without a name?"
<p>
    "OK, you're called Qin Guoben."
<p>
    "And you?"
<p>
    "My name is Lin Ailian."
<p>
    He suspected that she was tricking him and didn't
believe that he was called Qin Guoben, but couldn't think up
a reason to the contrary. He felt that his last name was
Lin, and hers was Qin. He wanted to write down this
discovery so he wouldn't forget it, but he realized that for
a long time already he had forgotten how to write. He seemed
like a caged animal. Day by day the cage was shrinking, but
he couldn't do anything about it. He hated the woman -- she
didn't want to say anything!
<p>
    Nevertheless, his memory was not completely blank. He
could recall trivial things quite clearly. He knew some
things that the woman couldn't remember -- for example, why
the wax figures were called Lives. The woman cherished her
figure. Unless it became intolerably cold, she would never
cut off a slice to get some warmth. But he did not care,
whenever he visited her, he would light the fire for her.
And he himself realized, in some sense, this came from his
concern for her. Perhaps it was just because of this that
the woman was willing to recount their stories when the
blazing fire lit up her face.
<p>
    Or perhaps, she still also cared a little for him? No!
The woman probably hated him, otherwise why did she torture
him like this? He could not recall why they had decided to
live apart. He lived on the hilltop, and she in the valley.
In the daytime he didn't go down to disturb her, but on
those dreamless nights, when he couldn't stand the solitude,
he would go down to look for her. Still, it didn't do him
any good but only increased his misery.
<p>
    One afternoon when he was chopping firewood, it suddenly
occurred to him that he could recall where he had come from.
He was extremely excited and ran shouting all the way down
the hill. The woman was mending some clothes when he burst
in, almost knocking her over.
<p>
    "I remember! I remember where we came from. We didn't
live here originally. Our home is on another planet, a
sea-blue planet -- just like a blue gem embedded in space.
Did you know that?"
<p>
    "I did."
<p>
    "Then why didn't you tell me?"
<p>
    "Why did I have to tell you? Now you remember where we
came from, but do you also remember why?"
<p>
    He couldn't answer. The anger in his heart was slowly
building up. This crafty woman was always thinking up ways
to make him feel uncomfortable. Abruptly, he grabbed her
hair and threw her to the ground. She screamed and it made
him angrier. He banged her head on the ground as hard as he
could -- thud, thud. She struggled for a while and started
to cry. Exhausting his energy, he began to pant and swear at
her.
<p>
    "You bitch! You're killing me! I want you to tell me
everything right now. I've been tricked too long. Tell me!
Why did we come here? Tell me! Will you tell me or not?"
<p>
    "It was you who agreed to come here with me," the woman
said crying. "It's you who said you'd never leave me again.
You said you wanted to forget everything about the past and
begin a new life. You yourself decided to take the amnesia
pill, no one forced you. The reason I didn't want to tell
you was because I was afraid...I was afraid you would
remember how you used to be and would leave me again. I've
had enough! Kill me! I've had enough!"
<p>
    The woman lay down and cried. He didn't know what to do,
but just sat next to her motionlessly. She finally stopped
crying, stood up, and said to him calmly, "It's in the cave
on the other side of the hill."
<p>
    "What's in the cave?"
<p>
    "The ship. There's still enough fuel in the
ship...enough for you to fly to the interplanetary station
on the plain. There's a bottle of silver pills in the
first-aid kit on the right side of the cabin. Take five, and
it should be enough to refresh your memory temporarily.
After that take three every eight hours. When you return,
see the doctors immediately. They have equipment that can
completely restore your memory."
<p>
    "And how about you?"
<p>
    "You don't have to worry about me." She gathered the
clothes that had been scattered on the floor. "You said this
was the last winter."
<p>
    When he left her, she lowered her head and sat in front
of the burnt out fire slowly stitching her clothes.
<p>
<br>
<p>
    Before the storm arrived, he had already shut himself up
alone in the hilltop cabin for three days. Then the storm
arrived and he knew he would not be able to leave the
planet. This made him feel at ease nevertheless. There were
enough provisions and firewood in the cabin, so he did not
have to worry about himself. But then he thought of the
woman in the valley -- he didn't remember whether he had
stocked up provisions and other necessities for her. He
should have thought about that, but he was not sure what he
had done. After thinking about it for a long time, he
decided to go down and look for the woman.
<p>
    He struggled down toward the valley through snow that
was already knee deep. The ghost snow, shining with green
phosphorous light, kept on falling. Half way down the hill
he slid and fell into a big rut. Fortunately, the snow was
deep and he was not hurt. He tried several times but failed
to climb out, and could only lie at the bottom, looking up
and panting as countless green lights danced in the sky.
Then he rubbed the melted snow off his face and tried hard
to get out one more time. And just when he was about to fall
back again, he managed to grab hold of a tree root.
<p>
    He clambered out of the snowy rut and continued moving
down the hill sliding and rolling. Finding the woman's cabin
in the valley nearly buried in a snow bank, he worked hard
and finally dug out the snow in front of the door. He
knocked for a long time, but the woman did not open the
door. He cursed loudly thinking it might be another trick,
but also worried that maybe something had really happened to
her. He went over to the back door, and again almost
exhausted himself clearing a way in. Luckily it was not
locked. He climbed into the room, and completely collapsed
on the floor.
<p>
    She was not in the cabin.
<p>
    After restoring his energy a bit, he searched the entire
cabin several times. No, she was not in. He wanted to rush
out and look for her, but also realized he did not have
enough energy. It seemed colder inside the cabin than
outside. Soaked to the skin he curled his body up and
listened to the howling wind. He peered out the window at
the ghost snow falling in a myriad of green, weblike strands
-- like a green net.
<p>
    At last, you're the only one left, he thought.
<p>
    His teeth could not stop chattering. He reached into his
pocket and touched an icy cold object -- a maimed figure,
without arms or legs, only a torso left.
<p>
    He pulled out the wax figure. In the green light from
outside, the figure seemed to emit a strange glow. He
stroked it for a while and tossed it into the hearth with a
shaky hand. Then he flicked the lighter and made a fire out
of the last piece of his Life.
<p>
    The blazing fire immediately changed the atmosphere in
the cabin. The green glow from the outside suddenly faded
away. He felt the heat in his chest come back and his face
began to warm up. Forgetting all at once about the snowstorm
outside, he concentrated on the white hot radiance of the
fire.
<p>
    He saw himself once again, now he could remember
everything. He knew who he was, where he had come from, and
also why he had come here. At the same time, he recalled
that old legend -- when the wax figure has turned to ash,
the figure's owner will also vanish with it.
<p>
    But he didn't care, just opened his mind's eye and
concentrated...It seemed that he had returned to the park
again. He was nine and she was seven. They sat by a pond
which was covered by a layer of thin mist. A lotus flower
bloomed in the middle. And from another corner of the pond
came the sounds of oars mixed with singing. He gazed at the
red blossom; the flower's color slowly began to fade -- from
red to something white. He felt himself also gradually
weakening. The cold crept up his back inch by inch. So the
old saying was really true! However, he stared fixedly at
the white lotus and was not at all afraid.
<p>
    Suddenly the flower changed color. It became intensely
red again. He startled, feeling his chest grow warm once
more. Then another hand grasped his, it was her hand.
<p>
    "I came here to look for you, but you weren't in." He
opened himself to her like a child.
<p>
    "I went to the top to search for you, but you weren't
there either."
<p>
    "Did you just toss your wax figure into the hearth?
<p>
    "Yes, I threw it all in."
<p>
    He cracked a smile and embraced her tightly. Together
they gazed at the last wax figure burning in the fire.
<p>
    Because even if it was just a memory, it still needed
the luminance of Life.
