<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<ul>
This course is an introduction to the architecture of and software techniques for parallel and high performance computing systems. The content includes fundamental architecture aspects of shared-memory and distributed-memory systems, as well as paradigms, algorithms and languages used to program parallel systems. Students will complete a number of projects demonstrating specific applications on parallel processing systems. 
</ul>

<h3>Textbooks </h3>
<ul>
About 50% of the material covered will be from:
<ul> An Introduction to Parallel Programming
<br> by Peter Pacheco
<br> Publisher: Morgan Kaufman
</ul>
The remaining 50% will be in lecture slides and 
material publicly available on the web.
</ul>

<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
<ul>
cs449 and cs1501 or knowledge of programming and fundamentals of computer systems.
Programming assignments will use the C language.
</ul>

<h3>The course will cover the following topics:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Introduction to parallel systems
<li> An introduction to chip Multiprocessor architectures
<li> Models of parallel processing
<li> A taste of parallel algorithms and programs
<li> Interconnection networks
<li> Cache coherence in symmetric multiprocessors
<li> Programming using multiple threads
<li> Programming using the message passing interface (MPI)
<li> Programming shared memory machines (OpenMP)
<li> Programming using Universal Parallel C (UPC)
<li> GPU architectures and CUDA
</ul>

<h3>Requirements and grading:</h3>
<ul>
Two exams (50%). 
<br>
Homeworks and projects (50%) - cs2045 students will do a research project.
</ul>

<h3>Policy on cheating and late homeworks</h3>
<ul>
Except for specfically designated team projects, 
homeworks are to be individual efforts. Collaboration
is considered cheating.
Cheating on exam or homeworks will results in a grade of "0" for the first
time (for all involved students) and an "F" in the course for the second time.
<br>
Late homeworks will not be accepted and
Exams will not be rescheduled except under extraordinary circumstances.
</ul>

<h3>Note for disabled students</h3>
If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Resources
and Services, 216 William Pitt Union (412-648-7890), as soon as possible in
the term. They will verify your disability and determine reasonable 
accommodations for this course.

<h3>Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) accounts:</h3>
In preparation for getting an account on PCS machines, each student is requested to apply for an XSEDE
(Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment) account.
To do this, go to
<a href = "https://portal.xsede.org/">
https://portal.xsede.org/ </a>
and click on "Create account" in the "enter the portal" sub-window.
It will not be possible to give you an account on PSC machines if you do not have an XSEDE account.
