<h3>7. TEXTBOOK, MUSICAL PLAY, TV SERIES AND MOVIE BASED ON CHANG'S NOVEL</h3>
<p>
The novel, "Chess King", was officially adopted as a textbook
for foreign students studying Chinese at the
Stanford Center (Inter-University Program for Chinese Language
Studies administered by Stanford University), Taipei, Taiwan.
In 1982, the Pacific Cultural Foundation funded a project
to prepare a glossary and a voice recording of the novel to serve as
the foreign student's companion (study aid).
In May 1987, a musical play based upon
"Chess King"
was staged in Taipei, Taiwan.  It was the first musical
play written in Chinese ever staged in China, with a total audience of over 50,000.
In February 1988, a TV mini-series based upon the same novel was
broadcast in Taipei.
A motion picture was produced in Taiwan and Hong Kong in 1989.
A German translation of the Chess King was published by Horlemann in October 1992.
In 1992, Chess King was adopted as supplementary reading for middle school students in Hong Kong.
