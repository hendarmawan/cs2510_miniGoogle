[marius giurgi]
is fractal a pattern?
[Jonathan Misurda]
i guess its a recursive self-similar pattern
[marius giurgi]
jonathan :) sure it is. I was hinting whether it's a good example of a pattern for the class. we should do some fractal software engineering
[Jonathan Misurda]
if you can think of an example, go for it
[jim clause]
try and do a project on it
[sk chang to Jim Clause in private]
 Jim,  please  give  Ex  3  to  TA   
 directly  by  e-mail.
[marius giurgi]
great. I will talk to him about my options.
[sk chang]
 hI  all
[marius giurgi]
hi
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
Good Evening Professor. Chang
[Jonathan Misurda]
hello
[Brian Smyth]
greetings everyone
[Ed Pavlak]
hello everyone
[sk chang]
 THis  is  week  6.    I  just  pushed  the 
 class  syllabus  page  to  you.
[Anna Nys]
Hi everyone
[prathyusha gandra]
 hello  everyone
[sk chang]
 Pleae  take  a  look  at  the  content  of 
 week  6.
[Audio from Chris Bryant]
hello
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
Ok.
[sk chang]
 I  would  like  to  ask  you  to  read 
 the  chapters  7  and  8,  and 
 then  the  "standard  interface"  which 
 are  slides  prepared  byXin  Li
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
Ok.
[sk chang]
 Next  week  when  we  resume 
 live  clases,  we  will  start  with 
 more  discussion  on  the  interface 
 and  the  message  server,  so  I 
 want  you  to  take  a  look  at  that 
 first.  Okay?
[marius giurgi]
java tool gives error when clicking on the links. why?Ë
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
Okay Professor. Chang.
[sk chang]
 Marius,  I  think  the  java  tool  still  has   
 certain  problems  that  Chris   
 Santamaria  is  try  to  fix.
[marius giurgi]
ok
[Brian Smyth]
Chris knows what the problem is; we did some debugging last time.
[sk chang]
 Ed,  Chris  Garman  you  will  both  be 
 working  on  the  teaching  tool.
[Anna Nys]
Dr. Chang, I think it's a problem with the message format in Xin Li's server, not the java tool.
[sk chang]
 Jonathan  and  Ricardo  you   
 will\both  be  working  on  porting  VC   
 java  to  the  handheld.
[Ricardo Villamarin]
Yes Dr. Chang, Actually is in J# :-)
[sk chang]
 Next  week  I  will  have  subgroup   
 meetings  with  you  guys  separetly   
 to  get  these  things  going.  Okay?     
 But  at  least  for  now  you  can   
 exchange  some  ideas.
[Christopher Garman]
just curious, but what handleheld systems will you be porting to?
[sk chang]
 They  are  enslaved  by  Bill  Gates,  I   
 am  not.
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
:)
[Rupa Natarajan]
Dr.Chang is someone else also working on the Message Server?Ë
[marius giurgi to sk chang in private]
I was wondering whether I could do a project on fractals, since patterns seem to be the main theme of the course. but I don't now how to bring that into the SE. any ideas?
[sk chang]
 Yes,  there  are  at  least  three   
 people.    I  need  to  go  to  my  notes.
[sk chang to Marius Giurgi in private]
 Marius  you  will  meet  me  next   
 Tuesday  and  we  can  discuss.
[sk chang]
 Rupa,  Dan  Ryker  and  Chris   
 Santamaria  are  working  on   
 message  servers  (different   
aspects)
[marius giurgi to sk chang in private]
ok
[Rupa Natarajan]
ok, thanks Dr.Chang
[sk chang]
 Ganesh  and  Gandra  are  working   
 on  negotiation  protocols,  again   
 one  on  theory  and  the  other  on   
 patterns  (java  segments)
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
Sure Professor. Chang
[sk chang]
 Yue  Zhang  and  Suresh  are   
 working  on  time  scheduling.
[sk chang]
 I  have  not  finished  talking  to   
 everybody,  so  by  next  Tuesday   
 we  will  have  all  a  complete   
picture.
[sk chang]
 And  next  week,  as  I  said,  we  will   
 break  into  subgroup  discussions.
[sk chang]
 To  summarize,  read  the  two   
 chapters  and  especially  the 
 "standard  interface". 

 Any  questions?
[Brian Smyth]
None here, sounds like a plan.
[Jonathan Misurda]
