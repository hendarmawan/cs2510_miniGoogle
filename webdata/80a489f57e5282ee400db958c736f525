How to connect to the local database using Oracle8i
</h1>


In the tutorial on <i>How to use Excel 
with an oracle Database</i>, the method that is used to connect to a local 
database is implemented in Oracle8, not Oracle8i. Here it is explained how to 
connect to the local database in Oracle8i. It is more complex than in Oracle8.

<h2>
1. Set Host Name for your computer
</h2>

If you don’t set the host name for your computer, you should do it now as 
following:
<p>
Go to control-panel => network => TCP/IP properties => DNS configuration => 
enable DNS => set your host name

<h2>
2. Configuring Naming Methods and the Listener
</h2>

Net8 can resolve net service names using the following methods:
Host naming, Local naming, Oracle Names method and External names 
methods. (See the exact usage in Oracle Document.)

<p>
We will use Host naming method here. Four steps are here:
<h3>
Step 1: Configure the Listener with the Global Database Name 
</h3>
Start Net8 Assistant => Listeners => LISTENER (this is the default one)
<br>
=> Choose Listening location from the drop-down list box: add address using 
TCP/IP protocol and your own Host name and port 1521;
<br>
=> Choose database services from the drop-down list box: set Global database 
name to LOCAL (Whatever, just a local database. But this is a very 
important parameter and will be used later.), Oracle home directory (where 
you want to put your database), and SID to ORCL

<h3>
Step2: Configure HOSTNAME as the First Naming Method
</h3>
(You are still in Net8 Assistant) => profile => Choose Naming from drop-
down list box => set HOSTNAME and TNSNAMES to be in the selected 
methods and make HOSTNAME as the first.
Save network configuration and exit from Net8 Assistant.

<h3>
Step3: Start your listener
</h3>
Use LSNRCTL utility to start your listener.
Find the location of lsnrctl.exe in your computer and run it. 
<br>
LSNRCTL > start : will start your listener. 
<br>
LSNRCTL > help : List all the commands for LSNRCTL

<h3>
Step4: create a new local net service Name
</h3>
Start net8 easy config => Add new Service => set New Net Service Name to 
whatever => use TCP/IP protocol => set service name to LOCAL (same as 
Global Database Name.) => then test it (user name: 'scott' and password: 
'tiger') => successfully
<p>
You can also use Net8 Configuration Assistant to do the step4.
Now you have a connection to the local database. You can use it afterwards 
in Excel.
In short, we can have a lot of net service names, based on the same net 
service (Global Database). If the service is used TCP/IP protocol, it must 
have a running listener.

To understand how Oracle 8i works, Oracle 8i Document is very helpful.
