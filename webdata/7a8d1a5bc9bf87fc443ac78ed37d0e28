Steps to test your Plug-in Component
 (Note: The lines preceeded by #'s can be ignored)

Step 1: Change directory to local directory
containing java source programs.

# cd c:\users\changsk\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\KSI\Universal Interface

Step 2: Compile the Interface Server.

javac InterfaceServer.java

Step 3: Run Interface Server where the parameter 64.107.76.77
is the IP address of the regular VC Name Server.

java InterfaceServer 64.107.76.77

 (The experimental VC5.0 Name Server is 64.107.76.78)

Step 4: Run the Universal Interface.

Click on prjRemote to run it

Step 5: Compile the Plug-in component.

javac PluginComponent.java

(or you may compile all java programs in the
 directory by:  javac *.java )

Step 6: Run the Plug-in component where the IP address
127001 is the local IP address of the Interface Server.

java PluginComponent 127001

Now you are ready to experiment with the
Universal Interface and the Plug-in Component.
