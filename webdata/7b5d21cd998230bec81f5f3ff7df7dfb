Problems With Using Web Matrix</font></h1> 





<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Even though Web Matrix is a <font color="#0000FF">free tool</font>, this 
    would be a great attracting factor. However, I feel like this factor alone
    <font color="#0000FF">isn't good enough </font>to motivate someone to keep 
    on working with the tool after a few hours, especially if they can work with
    <font color="#0000FF">Visual Studios. NET</font>.&nbsp; My personal 
    experience with this project makes me feel that it is <font color="#0000FF">
    more time-efficient</font> and <font color="#0000FF">convenient</font> just 
    to use Visual Studios. NET to develop web applications using ASP.NET.</p>
    <p>The following are some of the many problems I faced with over the course 
    of developing this application:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000FF">Lack of Intellisence: </font>&nbsp;This makes it 
      very inconvenient to write code simply because I was not very familiar 
      with the language.&nbsp; Since WebMatrix was <font color="#0000FF">built 
      for novice ASP.NET developers </font>so they don't have to deal with all 
      the overhead involved using Visual Studios .NET, it would be taken into 
      consideration that most of these users will not be familiar with all the 
      classes and methods it offers.&nbsp; And figuring out simple code can take 
      up hours if you are not aware of the correct method to use<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li><font color="#0000FF">No support: </font>&nbsp;The only support there 
      is are the <font color="#0000FF">online forums</font> and the small 
      articles on ASP.NET here and there available on the Internet.&nbsp; There 
      was one online book, but it was not very useful.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the online 
      forums, usually <font color="#0000FF">beginners and some experienced 
      developers</font> share their problems and solutions.&nbsp; This was 
      really my <font color="#0000FF">best resource</font> during the course of 
      this project -- relying on the fact that someone else may have had a 
      similar problem as me and that their solution works for me also<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li><font color="#0000FF">Many minor bugs: </font>&nbsp;In the properties 
      windows for the controls, if you click on the control which should take 
      you to your file browser so that you can choose a file or image to insert 
      or make as a <font color="#0000FF">background</font> in some control, 
      nothing happens.&nbsp; Instead, you have to type the <font color="#0000FF">
      entire path</font>--which can be very inconvenient</li>
    </ul>
