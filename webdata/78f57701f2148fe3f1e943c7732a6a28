<font color=red>The default guard predicate is the same for all problem sets and tests whether the problem set is empty to transfer to different cycle</font>.  The default guardi,j is defined as follows:  When the kth operator in the operator sequence for cyclei is applied to transform Pk-1 to Pk, if Pk is empty then control is transferred to cyclej and the initial problem set for cyclej is Pk-1; else the control remains with cyclei and the (k+1)th operator is applied to transform Pk to Pk+1. If Pk is the last problem set and there is no (k+1)th operator then M<sub>sis</sub> halts.
