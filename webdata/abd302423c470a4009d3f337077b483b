<ul>
   <li>Uses the JDBC API</li>
   <li>The JDBC was developed to become a universal standard on accessing
       databases. To reach this goal, a single set of Java objects
       was created that could be used to access any database.</li>
   <li>How can this be done?</li>
   <ul>
      <li>JDBC is structured around a set of Java interfaces called
          drivers.</li>
      <li>Each database that supports JDBC has its own set of drivers
          tailored specifically for itself.</li>
      <li>ADVANTAGE: Programmers do not have to know the specifics of a
          database that they are working on to create an application.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>How was this accomplished?</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Simple and common tasks are implemeted in simple
          interfaces. Complex and abstract tasks are implemented using
          extra interfaces.</li>
      <li>JDBC was built on SQL.</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Used more in association with relational databases than
             object-oriented databases.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Capitalizes on the experience of other database APIs.</li>
   </ul>
