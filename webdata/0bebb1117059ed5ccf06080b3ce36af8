   <h1>Why Search for Image Content?</h1>
   <br></br> 
<p>A question arises as to why create an image search engine based on
image content rather than just text. After all, the Google image search
engine returns valid results quickly by searching for text only. Also, 
text-based image search engines are easier to implement and design.</p>
<p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Often too expensive</b></li> 
<p>A small (or even large) image search can
require searching
large amounts of irrelevant web pages, resulting in very little hits,
possible irrelevant hits, and wasted time.</p>
   <li><b>A picture is worth a thousand words</b></li>
<p>It may be hard to describe a specific picture that you are looking
for, such as a picture of Galileo around the age of 35 holding a telescope
outside around midnight while wearing a white shirt, black pants, and no
shoes.</p>
   <li><b>Query word may not appear as a keyword</b></li>
<p>Suppose you are looking for an image of a unique pattern design, such
as a specific tie-dye pattern. What would you type in to find it? These
types of images can be difficult to find, and specific images can be
almost impossible to pinpoint, using a text-based image search.</p>
<li><b>Surrounding text may not describe the image</b></li>
<p>Again, you are searching for the specific picture of Galileo as
described above. There is a very good chance that the level of detail that
you want will not be described in the surrounding text of this picture,
leaving your search empty when it should not be.</p>
