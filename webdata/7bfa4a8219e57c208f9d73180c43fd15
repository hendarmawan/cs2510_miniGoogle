<font size=+1>CoE1502: Using Logic Analyzer</font></h3></center>
In order to test a real hardware design one need to be able to measure
the actual values of bus and signal lines. Logic analyzer is a great aid
for this purpose. With it one can collect output signals and view wave
forms.
<p>In our class we are using HP 1600 series logic analyzer.
<p>Our design will be synthesized and uploaded to the FPGA device on the
"Wild-One" board. The board is connected to the logic analyzer. Thus we
can run tests on our design and observe the results with the logic analyzer.
<h3>
How to use the Logic Analyzer (LA):</h3>
The LA has several sets of buttons on its front pannel:
<ul>
<li>
quick menu keys -- allow you to go to a particular menu of the system</li>

<li>
navigation keys -- allow you to move cursor in 4 directions and select
or confirm actions.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Arrows -- move cursor</li>

<li>
Select -- selects an option or performs the highlited function</li>

<li>
Done -- saves assignments and closes popup menus</li>

<li>
Knob -- by rotating the knob you can change values in some fields or scroll
the display, or move cursor</li>
</ul>

<li>
data entry keys -- for entering signal names and other data</li>

<li>
run and stop keys -- starts/stops measurement</li>
</ul>
The LA also has a 3" disk drive where one can save current setup or waweforms.
<p>When you want to make measurements with the LA, you have to go through
the following steps:
<ol>
<li>
Map to target (CONFIG. key)</li>

<li>
Set up analyzers (FORMAT key)</li>

<li>
Set up trigger (TRIGGER key)</li>

<li>
Run measurement (RUN key)</li>

<li>
View data (LIST / WAVEFORM keys)</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Map to Target (CONFIG. key)</h3>
This step configures the LA. Normally you do not need to make any changes
here and can skip to the next step.
<ul>
<li>
<i>Connect probes </i>-- this is already done and the LA is connected to
the Wild-One board with the FPGA on it.</li>

<li>
<i>Set type </i>-- selects operating mode of the LA</li>

<li>
<i>Assign pods </i>-- defines connections between the LA and the tested
device.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Set Up Analyzers (FORMAT key)</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Set modes and clocks --</i> The data can be gathered at certain time
intervals (using clocks) or at specific events (triggers). Here we make
a choice, how we would like to collect data.</li>

<li>
<i>Group bits under labels</i> -- For our convenience we can create logical
busses by collecting incoming signals in a bus and giving the bus a name.
Later in the waweform the collection of these signals will be labeled by
the bus name.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Set Up Trigger (TRIGGER key)</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Define terms </i>-- define trigger variables to match certain events
(patterns, ranges, edges) in your target system</li>

<li>
<i>Configure arming control </i>-- if you want the LA to trigger an external
instrument or vica verse</li>

<li>
<i>Set up trigger sequence </i>-- set up when the LA starts and stops collecting
data, and which data is to be gathered.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Run Measurement (RUN key)</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Select single or repetive </i>-- a single run will run until the memory
is full. a repetitive will run until you press STOP ot until a stop condition
(defined before) is fullfilled</li>

<li>
<i>If nothing happens</i>, press Stop and find out why (incorrect triggers,
...?)</li>

<li>
<i>Gather data </i>-- press RUN and hold your breath...</li>
</ul>

<h3>
View Data (LIST / WAVEFORM keys)</h3>
Here we can view the results of our test run and see if we get what we
expected.
<ul>
<li>
<i>Search for patterns</i></li>

<li>
<i>Correlate data</i></li>

<li>
<i>Make measurements</i></li>
</ul>
After this step you can go back to trigger setup, or make changes in your
design, synthesize, upload and run the measurement again.
