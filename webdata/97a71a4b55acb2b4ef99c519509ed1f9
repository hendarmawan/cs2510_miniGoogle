<h1>Test Automation</h1>
The bonus mini-project report is only one page -
one paragraph for each item below and one screen shot for third item.
Then you will give a demo on your implementation.
<h2>1. What feature/function you want to add to your
baseline system?
</h2>
Please select some feature that is an improvement
of an existing function.
<h2>2. What tests do you want to perform?
</h2>
Please come up with a short checklist of the tests
you want to perform.  
<h2>
3. How do you plan to implement it?
</h2>
Either you implement a test driver yourself
or you rely on Selenium.  A screen shot
of either approach should be included here.

<h2><font color=red>
After the final exam, please come to my office
to give the demo.
