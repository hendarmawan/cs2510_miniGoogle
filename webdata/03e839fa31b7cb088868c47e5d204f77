<h3 class="title">Academic Honesty</h3>
<!--	  <p>Do not plagiarize.&nbsp; See <a
	  href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Eciddeweb/FACULTY-DEVELOPMENT/TA_HANDBOOK/end-draft.htm">http://www.pitt.edu/~ciddeweb/FACULTY-DEVELOPMENT/TA_HANDBOOK/end-draft.htm</a> for definition and examples.  <b>Plagiarizers will fail this course and receive disciplinary actions according to university policies</b>.</p> -->
<p>All submitted work <b>must be your own work</b>.
<b>Plagiarizers will fail this course and receive
disciplinary actions according to university policies</b>.<br>
</p>
<p>You may discuss the assignments with each other;
you may also refer to printed literature and web resources for
background research. <b>However</b> you must list the names of people
with whom you have had discussions and provide proper citations to any
resources to which you referred. Failure to do so is considered
plagiarism. </p>
<h3 class="title">Absences</h3>
<p>If an absence is unavoidable, you are responsible for making
arrangements <b>to ensure that your assignments are turned in on time</b>.
You are also responsible for obtaining the materials passed out and the
information announced during the missed class. In case of extraordinary
circumstances (hospitalization, family emergency) you should contact me
as soon as possible so that we may arrange an extension for an
assignment or schedule a make-up exam <i>prior to the due date</i>.
Late assignments <b>will not</b> be accepted. No make-ups will be
given for pop-quizzes</p>
<h3 class="title">Course Grade</h3>
<p>The course grade will be decided based on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Class participation (10%) </li>
  <li> Assignments (20%) </li>
  <li> Exam 1 (15%) </li>
  <li> Exam 2 (20%) </li>
  <li> Term Project (35%) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Project Proposal (10%)</li>
    <li>Project Presentation (10%)</li>
    <li>Project Draft Review (5%)</li>
    <li>Project Report (10%)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<!---
<h3 class="title">Lecture Notes</h3>
<p>Lectures will be presented using "traditional" methods of magic
markers on whiteboards. Powerpoint presentations will be minimal (See <a
 href="http://www.norvig.com/Gettysburg/">here</a> for why too much
Powerpoint is a bad idea). Therefore, lecture notes <span
 style="font-style: italic;">will not</span> typically be online. You
are responsible for taking good notes during class.</p>

<h3 class="title">Homework Assignments</h3>
-->
<h3 class="title">Required Textbook</h3>
<p>By <i>required</i>, I mean that you are responsible for the
assigned materials in the specified textbook(s). You have the
perogative to choose any <b>legal</b> means of obtaining the required
information in the textbook (NB: I have reserved a copy of the
textbook(s) in Hillman Library). However, <b>the responsibility of
obtaining the material in a timely manner is yours alone</b>. For
example, if the book you purchased should arrive three weeks late, you
are responsible to find alternative means of accessing the textbook.
Similarly, if you inherited an earlier edition of the book, it is your
responsibility to discover the differences between your version and the
official version. </p>
<h3 class="title">Office Hours</h3>
<p>In addition to regularly scheduled office hours, you may make
appointments for further meetings with the TA and the instructor;
however, these appointments should be made at least a day in
advance.</p>

<h3 class="title">Students With Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and
Disability Resources and Services, 216 William Pitt Union, (412)
648-7890/(412) 383-7355 (TTY), as early as possible in the term. DRS
will verify your disability and determine reasonable accomodations for
this course. </p>
