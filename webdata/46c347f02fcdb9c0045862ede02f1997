<h1>SOW for G6</h1>

We would like to do something in our project that involves sound to change the
state of the machine to perform different actions onscreen. I was thinking
this would go well with Scenario 6. Snakeman while trying to stop the hero
could have some dialog that would set the state so that the valve could be
turned.
