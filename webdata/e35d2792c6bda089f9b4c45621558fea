Steps to test your Plug-in Component for SIS Kinect Project

Step 1: Start the SISServer
Go to the SIS Testbed/Scripts directory, double click the RunServer.bat to start the SIS Server.
Or you can go to Testbed/System/SISServer directory, type the following command in the command line tool:
	javac SISServer.java
	java SISServer

Step 2: Start the prjRemote
Double click the prjRemote.jar to start the SIS visual administrator.
Or you can goto Testbed directory, type the following command in the command line tool:
	java -jar prjRemote.jar

Step 3: Connect the prjRemote to SISServer
Input the SISServer IP and Port in prjRemote(the default is 127.0.0.1 and 7999, for the current test, you need not change anything), then click "connect", your prjRemote should successfully connect to the SISServer.


Step 4: Load Initialization XML for KinectServer
In prjRemote, click the load button, then choose the xml file Testbed/Kinect/xml/InitXML/CreateKinectServer.XML, then click the send button.

Step 5: Start the Kinect Server
Go to Testbed/Kinect/Scripts directory, double click RunKiNectServer.bat to start the Kinect Server.
Or you can go to Testbed/Kinect/System/KinectServer, type the following command in the command line tool:
	javac *.java
	java KinectServer

Step 6: Load Initialization XML for your test component
You can use prjRemote to create your initialization xml, the left pane is editable.
Your init xml should at least include 406 as your OutputMsgID and 408 as your InputMsgID.
After create the xml, send it to SISServer by clicking send button.

PS: to add a new empty line in left pane of prjRemote, just double click on the empty space of left pane.

Step 7: Run your test component
Your component should do the following, send a 406 msg to request for Kinect file, receive the 408 response msg from KinectServer, download the corresponding file from the url specified within the received 408 file. 

PS: your component should send a msg 23 stating itself with correct Name field to successfully connect to SISServer once it sets up the socket connection with SISServer. The Name field should be the same with which in your initialization XML. All the messages routed through the SISServer will be displayed in the right pane of prjRemote.

Step 8: Finish the test
Turn off your test component first, then Kinect Server, then prjRemote, finally the SISServer.
