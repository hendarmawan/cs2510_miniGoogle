			<b>Like content-based image retrieval, content-based document retrieval goes through similar process of data flow.  Documents are processed and features were extracted.  A similarity function is applied based on the features extracted to determine relevance of document.</b>
			<p><b>Pre-Processing:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Extract text and structure from raw document (Word document, html, etc.)</li>
				<li>Remove stop words from document (the, at, all, etc.)</li>
				<li>Stemming - Converting words to stems (processing => process)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				<b>Features Extraction:</b><br>
				- Words are projected into vectors.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Computing Relevance (Similarity):</b><br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Vector Based Model</i><br>
						- Document and query is represented by vector.<br>
						- Elements of vector are frequency of words.<br>
						- Similarity is calculated by calculating distance between the query vector and document vector.<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Probabilistic Model</i><br>
						- Relevance is based on users feedback or ranking of the vector model.<br>
						- Relevance of the document is represented as probability.
					</li>
				</ul>
