Introduction to Mentor Graphics FPGA Advantage</h2></center>
The goal of this course is to learn about the tools and techniques
of advanced digital design. A single design project will span the entire
semester:  the design of a modern&nbsp; microprocessor based on the MIPS
architecture (similar to the one described in your computer architecture textbook).
<p>One of the fundamental notions of modern digital design is to describe
the operation of the device as completely as possible and as early as possible
in the design cycle. What may be lacking in detail from these descriptions
will be easily made up for by the early detection of design errors. Thus,
for much of this course you will describe your design in software, using
a <i>Hardware Description Language</i> called <b>VHDL</b>.  You will verify its
operation using a VHDL simulator. Eventually you will implement the design
in hardware using a device known as a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).
<p>A hardware description language is a textual programming language, which
is used to describe the behavior of a digital device so that it may be
simulated (tested) and eventually synthesized into a low-level logic design.
Although this is textual programming language, you will not actually spend
much time entering text. The tools that you will be using support graphical
interfaces for design description that are automatically translated into
VHDL text. These are commercial design tools from Mentor Graphics Inc.
and are widely used in commercial design. We will use a packaged
set of tools for FPGA design called <i>FPGA Advantage</i>.
<p>Mentor Graphics FPGA Advantage is a collection of three tools:
<li>
<b>HDL Designer</b> is a graphical HDL design entry tool which will be used to
create your design.</li>

<li>
<b>ModelSim</b> is a simulator will be used to test your design.</li>

<li>
<b>Leonardo Spectrum</b> is a synthesis tool which will be used to map
your design into the FPGAs on the hardware boards.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>HDL Designer</b> is a <i>graphical</i> HDL design entry tool which will
automatically generate much of the raw code from higher level models that
you create through block diagrams (similar to schematics design), state
machine diagrams, truth tables, flow charts, and small segments of text
code. The course will begin by showing you these different methods of
entering your design data, giving you a brief refresher on digital logic
and simulation techniques, and providing you with an overview of the design process
which we we will be using in this class.  We will start by walking you through
the design of our Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) as a tutorial.
<p>The first several units are a tutorial to guide you through the basic
operation of the Mentor Tools. During this tutorial, you will design and
implement an integer ALU that you will eventually incorporate into your
microprocessor design. Before we start the tools, the next page will provide
you will a specification for the ALU.
