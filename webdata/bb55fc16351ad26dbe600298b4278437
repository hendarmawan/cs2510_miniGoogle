<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The final type of user identified 
  to use this type of system would be that of emergency medical personnel. This 
  type of user differs greatly from that of the other two categories in that this 
  type of personnel are very often employees of private companies/organizations 
  and are not directly associated with the local governments. Addtionally, the 
  types of personnel that would benefit from this type of system would be wide 
  ranging, from doctors and nurses, to ambulance personnel. As a result of this, 
  these users must be able to user hardware that is widely available. In most 
  cases a company would be unwilling or unable to provide the emergency medical 
  personnel with the same level of hardware found in a police cruiser. To address 
  this issue, it has been decided that these individuals can use mobile phones 
  and personal digital assistants (PDAs) equiped with HTML 4 compatible browsers. 
  The primary user in this category would be ambulance personnel. Since it is 
  expected that there will be at least one care giver in addition to the driver, 
  using a mobile phone to transmit the data to them is a feasible means of communicating 
  the state of the system. This type of adaptation requires explicit requests 
  to update the information since wireless handhelds have limited band width in 
  addition to air-time charges that may apply. Additionally, to adapt to the severely 
  restricted space available on wireless handheld screens, text only is sent to 
  these devices. The information included on this type of device is the estmated 
  delay and estimated time until block for each of the railroad crossings in question.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In all of these cases, once 
  common requirement becomes apparent. The users of this system have other things 
  to worry about other than operating this system. The system should be as transparent 
  to the user as possible. As such, the adaptations that take place are typically 
  a result of a single user action than then cascades down to adapt the media 
  to the device and audience that needs to diagest it. For this system to be successful, 
  it needs to provide the persons with the information they need with as little 
  interaction as possible. No matter what their role, they have a common goal 
  of saving lives, and this system should support that goal, not hinder it, or 
  even worse, create a greater lose of life by intruding in on the concentration 
  that had previously been reserved for the job at hand. The nature of this adaptive 
  media system is to adapt to not only the device on which the media is displayed, 
  but also the environment in which it must be absorbed. In the case of the mobile 
  phone or PDA interface which is the most interactive by not providing automatic 
  updates, and only being in text to accomodate the device limitations, the risk 
  of loss of concentration by the driver is mitigated through the expectation 
  that multiple people will be in the ambulance and will be able to provide the 
  driver with the information he or she needs to route a quick course to the emergency 
  scene or to medical care center.</font></p>
