Project:

I will explore the evolution of privacy in online social networks. I want to
examine the network, Facebook specifically, as composed of two distinct
groups with their own SIS characteristics; the network as a business, and
the users of that network. I feel they both have their own characteristics
due to their circumstances. The business has a drive to create revenue, and
the users interact with the network so they can have meaningful
communication with other members of the network. At this stage, I feel it's
the business that makes the decisions as to how it will drive revenue in the
future, mostly based on making more and more personal information available
to outside advertisers, and the users react with regards to how they feel
about their privacy is affected in such networks.

I've got two excellent papers, if you are interested in reading further into
the topic of privacy. They're attached.

Comments: Good.  The two SIS systems will interact.
It will be interesting to analyze the communication
patterns.
