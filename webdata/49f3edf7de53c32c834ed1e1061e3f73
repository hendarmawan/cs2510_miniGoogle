The objective of our project is to track the motion of an object thrown towards the Kinect and translate the trajectory of the object into virtual space. Our initial scenario was that when we throw an object towards Kinect the Kinect would get the information about the trajectory (3d point at various times in the motion). Based on the information of the trajectory we would visually translate the motion into virtual space. 

However, later in the project we got information from Group 3 and 5 that the ball cannot be tracked by the Kinect with the current components. So, with professor's permission we were using points from a text file as points of trajectory of the ball. Using these points we were able to translate the motion into the virtual space. So, in the future if some one builds a component that is able to track the motion of the ball this component can easily produce the corresponding virtual motion of that ball. 

Currently our project can run using either an Oni file or directly connecting the Kinect. The program would detect a hand wave as a sign that the ball motion would start. Then using the points in the textfile it would generate the virtual trajectory. So, we can provide the component a oni file that has a hand wave signal and the program would run. When the Kinect is connected directly, someone should signal an hand wave which would initiate the component and the virtual trajectory is generated.
