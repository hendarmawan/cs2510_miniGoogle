   <h1>What They Currently Do</h1>
   <br></br>
Currently, image search engines do not have these six idealistic features
incorporated with them. But what they do have are the following:
<ul>
   <li>Search by keywords and fomal attributes</li>
   <li>Display the image as part of your search results</li>
</ul>
<br>
Searching internal databases to a site are currently off-limits to search
engines, leaving this feature's implementation in doubt.
<br><br>
Finding the rights-holder to an image can be easily found using Google,
but some problems may arise. For example, Google returns the URL to the
page where the image was found. This can make finding the rights-holder to
the image quite trivial. However, problems arise when an image found in a
given domain resides in a different domain. This can make the task of
tracking the true owner of the image a time-consuming and sometimes
difficult task, but usually can be done.
