    <p><b><br>
    Thoughts <font color="#0000FF">After</font> Completing the Project: </b>&nbsp;I 
    believe ASP.NET Web Matrix is merely an attempt by <font color="#0000FF">
    Microsoft</font> to people frustrated enough to just <font color="#0000FF">
    buy Visual Studios .Net </font>to make any Web Applications using ASP.NET.&nbsp; 
    It was supposed to be an easy to use tool, but as I searched for solutions 
    to my problems in the <font color="#0000FF">online forums,</font> I realized 
    that many other users had the same problems.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The <font color="#0000FF">solutions?</font>&nbsp; Some little detail 
    which would probably take weeks to figure out or maybe never if simple 
    configurations are unknown to the developer.&nbsp; I was able to solve many 
    problems by <font color="#0000FF">changing some setting</font> which had 
    nothing to do with the language--rather some minor detail which was left 
    unspecified.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>I <font color="#0000FF">don't think</font> this is the how a tool should 
    be.&nbsp; After using this, I am pretty thankful for the
    <font color="#0000FF">features Visual Studios .NET</font> has to offer and 
    would never do another problem using Web Matrix.&nbsp; I am not sure if this 
    was the purpose of Microsoft when they released this free software--maybe 
    just to show users an example of very bad <font color="#0000FF">time-wasting 
    application</font> development tool&nbsp; I <font color="#0000FF">wouldn't 
    recommend</font> using Web Matrix to anyone after doing this project, 
    especially after using Visual Studios .NET.&nbsp; Actually, I believe it 
    would developers to <font color="#0000FF">stay away from ASP.NET completely</font>, 
    especially if they haven't used a better development tool such as Visual 
    Studios .NET.</p>
    <p><b>However</b>, overall, I think it was a good learning experience 
    everyone should have.&nbsp; Not only did I get to create an application from<font color="#0000FF"> 
    scratch to finish</font>, but also I used a <font color="#0000FF">beta 
    version tool </font>to implement such an application.&nbsp; This made me 
    realize that every software goes through <font color="#0000FF">many phases 
    of testing and debugging </font>before the final product is considered
    <font color="#0000FF">&quot;bug-free.&quot; </font>&nbsp;This is a process that not 
    only I will go through, but also big companies like Microsoft.&nbsp; We 
    forget that these companies also go though the same process when we use 
    their tools which work <font color="#0000FF">perfectly</font>.</p>
