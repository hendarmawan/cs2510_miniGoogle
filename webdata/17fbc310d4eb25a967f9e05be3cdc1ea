<blockquote>Managers, employees, and business partners sign onto PlanView
through a dynamically built web page called HomeView. Everyone's HomeView
portal reflects their rights to the information in the central repository,
and the unique needs of their role in the enterprise. When the user signs
on to the system, his or her profile is recalled, and a unique set of features
is placed on the menu for their use.</blockquote>
