<h1>Software Agents</h1>

<h3>
Agents are specialized kinds of components, offering
greater flexibility than traditional components.
<p>
Agents use dynamically adaptable rich message-based interaction,
and flexible knowledge-based techniques to make it easier
to build and evolve systems as requirements and technologies change.
