<h3>Course Description</h3>
<ul>
This advanced seminar will review the latest developments in two specific areas of computer architectures. The first relates to the processor, interconnection and system designs for high performance and high productivity computer systems, used to be called supercomputers. The second relates to architectures specifically suited for cognitive information processing. In addition we will review the latest developments in multiprocessor and multithreaded architectures as well as novel techniques for improving efficiency and decreasing power consumption.
