<LI><H2>composition
</H2>
<UL>
<LI><b>parallel/serial</b>, many multimedia authoring systems consider
them as 
fundamental divisons, yet they are in fact one form of
composiion: <b>time-dependent composition</b> <UL>
<LI>parallel: one item is active at the same time as another item
<LI>serial: one item starts only when another finishes
</UL><LI><b>time-independent composition</b>
<UL>
<LI>no predefined spatial or time relation between 2 items. This allows 2
or more prsentation to be played at the same time. <p>
An example is where a presentation is built up of several subscenes. A
number of items remain playing on the screeen (i.e. heading, background
music) while the user selects the different subscenes. There is no timing
relation between the items that remain on the screen and those playing in
the subscenes. </UL></UL></UL><UL> <LI><H2>anchors </H2>
<UL>
<LI>means of referring to part of an item in a  media independent 
way: they are an abstraction that allows data dependencies
to be kept hidden.</UL></UL></P>
