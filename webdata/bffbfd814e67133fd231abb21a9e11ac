<h1>Patterns and Index Cells</h1>
<h3>
According to Christopher Alexander, a pattern is a morphological law that establishes a set of relationships in space. In the most general form: 

<p>
X -> r (A, B, ...), which means: 

<p>
Within a context of type X, the parts A, B, ... are related by the relationship r. 

<hr>
Later he expanded his definition as follows:

<p>
Each pattern is a three-part rule r(P, X, S), which expresses a relation r between a certain context X, a problem P, and a solution S. 

<p>
(The 'problem' part can be understood as the semantics of the pattern)
