<h2 align = center>Programming for Oracle using Excel and Visual Basic</h2>
<pre>
	First here is a link to some general information on using Oracle Objects for OLE
Bound Widget Libraries and C++ Class Libraries.<a href="BOUND.html">C++ Library</a>

	In the previous link are some very useful sections of code describing how to
instantiate and use Oracle Objects in C++ and other OLE supported environments.  
PLEASE note that BORLAND C++ at any level is NOT supported by Oracle any longer.  You will
NOT be able to use the files provided with Borland's C++ compilers.

	I will now focus on using Oracle 8 Objects in an Excel spreadsheet.  The following
links will take you through a sample set (provided by Oracle) of macros used in Excel
	<a href = "ExCursRet.html">Cursor Return</a>
	<a href = "ExGetData.html">Get Data</a>
	<a href = "ExUpData.html">Update Data</a>
	<a href = "ExGetArr.html">Get Array</a>

	The following link goes over how to use Excel and incorporate Oracle programming 
into a spreadsheet.  It also tells you where to find the TNS-server name that you will use
when creating your OraDatabase Objects. <a href = "myexample.html">My example</a>
