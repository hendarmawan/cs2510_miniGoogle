* wxWindows continues to gather significant momentum, with big names and companies adopting it. 
As desktop use of Linux continues to grow, and with it the need for
 wxWindows. Many people are finding that wxWindows is the fastest route to porting their MFC applications to Linux, other Unix variants, and Mac. So the future 
for wxWindows is brighter than ever.<br><br>

* wxWindows will continue to be developed and improved by volunteers, who have a range of interests in wxWindows - some contribute in order to implement 
a particular application, and some because there is consultancy and exposure within the industry.<br><br>
