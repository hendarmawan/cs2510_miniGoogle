<h2>GUI</h2>

The GUI should be able to load the test scripts
consisting of XML messages.
These messages are stored in a folder or
directory.  Lets say your messages are m10, m11 and
m12.  Then your folder will contain m10.xml, m11.xml
and m12.xml.  Your test script will be another
file test101, containing the list of messages, say
m10, m12 and m11, in that order.  In the final demo, you will
either use PrjRemote.exe to load and send messages
m10, m12 and m11, or use your own GUI to load the
test script test101, and the GUI will send the
messages m10, m12 and m11, in that order.
<p>

If you are using Android to implement app on mobile phone,
for final demo your Android app will generate
on the side either XML messages directly, or
e-mail messages that are transformed into
XML messages.  These messages can be displayed
by PrjRemote.exe on the right-hand side (as output
messages). 
Therefore, the display of test script (the
messages) by PrjRemote.exe becomes a side effect
of running your Andrio app.
