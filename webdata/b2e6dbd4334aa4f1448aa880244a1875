<p>
This is an announcement for the 
</p><p>
<strong>Third Workshop on Models and Algorithms
for Planning and Scheduling Problems</strong>

</p><p>
Copy of the <a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/workshops/199704mapsp/brochure.ps">brochure</a> which will be 
mailed out (200 K).
</p><p>
The first workshop was held at Lake Como, Italy, in 1993, and a second
in Wernigerode, Germany, in 1995. The third workshop is planned for
Cambridge, England in 1997.  The workshop aims to provide a forum for
scientific exchange and cooperation in the field of planning,
scheduling and related areas.

To maintain the informality of the previous workshops and to encourage
discussion and cooperation, there will be a limit of 80 participants
and a single stream of presentations.

</p><p>
The workshop has sponsorship from the London Mathematical Society and from
the EPSRC.  This sponsorship can help support EPSRC and other students
who wish to attend the workshop.
</p><p>


Contributions on any aspect of scheduling are welcome.
The <a href="#invited">invited speakers</a> 
will particularly emphasise the topics of
</p><p>
- analysis of approximation algorithms<br>
- local search<br>
- scheduling of modern manufacturing systems<br>
- stochastic scheduling
</p><p>
The workshop will start with lunch, at 12.30 on Monday and in
the morning on Friday.  It includes an excursion on Wednesday afternoon
and a feast in the mediaeval hall on Thursday evening.
</p><p>

Authors presenting papers at the workshop are invited to submit their
manuscripts for possible publication in <strong>a special issue of
<em>Annals of Operations Research</em></strong>.  Papers for this
special issue will be refereed in the normal way.

</p><h2><font color="#008000">EPSRC Student Funding</font></h2>

Funds have now been made available from the MATHFIT initiative to
subsidize student participation in workshop.  MATHFIT - Mathematics
for IT - is a programme jointly sponsored by the EPSRC and LMS (the
London Mathematical Society).  We can cover the equivalent of 50% of
the registration and accommodation fee for six EPSRC students.  So, if
you are an EPSRC student, scheduling is your area of research, and you
were restrained from applying earlier for lack of funding, then here
is your chance!
<p>
Students have until 17 February to register for the workshop.


</p><h2><font color="#008000">Cambridge</font></h2>

The city of Cambridge is without doubt one of the most beautiful
cities in Britain and has captivated countless visitors with its
magnificent historic buildings, its elegant bridges, manicured lawns
and open parks along the River Cam and the wide variety of
architectural styles that are to be found in its college courtyards
and chapels.

<p>

Originally a Roman Settlement, the growth of Cambridge began in the
5th century, when it began to prosper as a market town and as a
trading route between eastern and Central England.  By the beginning
of the 13th Century the religious orders that had settled in and
around the city began to attract scholars and in 1284 the first
college, Peterhouse, was founded by the Bishop of Ely.  Today the
university comprises a total of 32 colleges, each a separate self
governing body and each with its own architectural Style and
Character. Among the most beautiful are Queens', Trinity, St. John's,
Clare and King's.
</p><p>
In recent years there has been a rapid and
sustained growth of high-tech firms working at the forefront of
technologies such as computing, biotechnology, electronics and
telecommunications, and benefiting from close links with the
University. This growth is often referred to as the "Cambridge
phenomenon".

for further tourist information about Cambridge.
</p><p>

Additional tourist information for Cambridge 
will be available at registration.
</p><p>

</p><h2><font color="#008000">Accommodation / Queens' College</font></h2>

The workshop will take place in Queens' College.  

<p>Founded in 1448 by Margaret of Anjou, 
`to laud and honneure of sexe femenine',
Queens' has been called `<em>the most
complete and compact example of a mediaeval College at
Cambridge</em>'.  With its mellow red brick, arched windows,
setting on the backs of the river Cam, 
and buildings from each of the last six centuries, 
the college is a pleasant
setting for an intimate workshop.
</p><p>

Accommodation will be in the modern Cripp's Court.  Bed and breakfast,
with optional lunch, is available for spouses, and double rooms can be
provided by request.  Bed and breakfast is available for Friday and
Saturday nights for persons who want to stay on
in Cambridge after the workshop.  Please contact Richard Weber if you
require any of these extras.

</p><h2><font color="#008000">Fees</font></h2>

The accommodation
fee is <strong>215 pounds</strong>.  This includes four nights'
lodging, lunches Monday-Thursday, breakfasts Tuesday-Friday, coffee
and tea each morning and afternoon, and the workshop banquet on
Thursday evening.

<p>

The registration fee is <strong>80 pounds</strong>
and covers the reception on Monday evening,
and an excursion Wednesday afternoon.  


</p><p>
Details of payment method will be
advised with acceptance notification in January.  Full
payment of accommodation and registration (295 pounds) is required
by February 17, although late registration will be considered, subject
to available space, for an increased registration fee of
120 pounds.
