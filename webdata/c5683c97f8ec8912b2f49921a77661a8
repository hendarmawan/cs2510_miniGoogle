<blockquote>More than 60% of all companies today are either fully or substantially
project-centered companies. That is, all or most of the profitability of
these companies comes through projects, of either a product or service
nature. And this number is likely to rise considerably over the next decade
as virtual organizations continue to proliferate. As such, the need to
either improve or adapt to project management tools and methodologies will
only increase.Use of the DPM tools is growing rapidly because they are
comparatively cheaper and easy to use.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Using the Internet, enterprises can now more easily support
geographically disbursed project teams-a project manager in Dallas can
schedule and manage team members in San Jose, Detroit, and Berlin, for
instance. Everyone is updated in real-time over the web on changes in project
priorities, workforce availability and skills, document updates, and other
critical business needs.</blockquote>
