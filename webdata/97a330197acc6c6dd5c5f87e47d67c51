<LI> Effort measurement based on System Size
</UL><UL>
	Boehm’s Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) - lines of code
</UL><UL>
	Variation for Computer Aided Learning (CAL) -course delivery time and cost 	drivers

Although some aspects are useful wider applicability to other types of multimedia development is unclear

<LI>Effort based on Functionality
</UL><UL>
	Function Point Analysis (FPA) - quantifies weighted contribution
</UL><UL>
	Gao and Lo suggest ineffective for multimedia - Why?
