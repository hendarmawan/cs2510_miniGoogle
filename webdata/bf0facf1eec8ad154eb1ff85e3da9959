<p><b><font size=+1>Middleware:</font></b>
<blockquote>Middleware is a general term for any programming that serves
to "glue together" or mediate between two separate and usually already
existing programs. A common application of middleware is to allow programs
written for access to a particular database to access other databases.
Messaging is a common service provided by middleware programs so that different
applications can communicate.
<p>To support the actual construction of component-based systems, middleware
for connecting components provides a technical foundation.</blockquote>
Three major middleware approaches for component-based software engineering
are:
<ul>
<li>
The Common Object Request Broker Architecture(<b>CORBA</b>) of the Object
Management Group(OMG)</li>

<li>
Sun's <b>Java Beans and Enterprise Java Beans</b></li>

<li>
Microsoft's Component Object Model(<b>COM+</b>)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XML can be combined with such object-oriented
middleware.
