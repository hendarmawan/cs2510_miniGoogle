<h3>Term Project Topic:
Using UML's
<a href="http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/1635/c03UMLDPL/c01.htm">deployment diagram</a>
an application system with
SIS server can be
specified.
You can first transform the (I-card, C-card)
specification (such as the example of
<a href="sisic7.htm">social influence anslysis system</a>
in the next slide) into an UML deployment diagram
(such as the example of
<a href="http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/interface/SequenceSIS.htm">
personal health care system</a>)
either manually or semi-automatically
and then visually present it using a suitable UML tool.
Then you can use the SIS testbed to implement and
simulate the SIS application system.

This topic is for those who are already familiar
with Petri net and those who are interested in
implementation type of projects.
