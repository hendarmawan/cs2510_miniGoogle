<b>Prerequisites:&nbsp; </b>
Knowledge of Computer Science
through CS1501 and CS1502. 
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<b>Textbook:&nbsp; </b>Artificial Intelligence: a modern approach
(third edition), S. Russell and P. Norvig, Prentice Hall.  Be sure to
get the third edition (the one with the blue cover).

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<b>Grade Basis:</b>
<p>
<ul> Assignments: 40%</ul>
<ul> Mid-term:  25% </ul>
<ul> Final: 35%  </ul>
<ul> Addressing a question from lecture: up to 2 extra-credit points
(optional; once for the semester)
  </ul>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<b>Assignments:</b>
Assignments will be mixtures of programming and written
assignments.  Some involve extending code given to you.  The
code will be in Python.  If you have never used Python, go through
the 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/"> tutorial </a> on the
Python website.
<br> <br>
Due dates are strict.  Extensions will be granted
only in the case of (documented) extreme circumstances.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<b>Exams:</b>
Exams will be closed book/closed notes/closed electronics.     
<br> <br>
The final exam will cover the entire course.
<br> <br>
The "wrap up" slides at the end of lecture notes give guidance about
what you are responsible for.
<br><br>
<!-- This description makes more sense for the midterm exam than for --
  -- the material in the second part of the course.  That's ok, --
  -- the purpose is to try to get them on the right track at the --
  -- beginning of the course.   When I get to later material I can --
  -- alert them to the types of things that may be on the exam. --
  -- Actually, the wrap up slides do that as well. -->
Generally speaking, you should be able to apply the algorithms,
heuristics, and techniques to examples without having the code,
lecture notes, or the book in front of you.   
<br><br>
When you are asked to trace an algorithm, I will ask a specific question,
such is what is currently on the fringe as a search
progresses.
<br><br>
Questions about knowledge representation schemes or writing
logical sentences will be closely related to examples we cover 
in class or on the assignments.
<br><br>
Other types of questions include definitions; the differences/relations
among algorithms or techniques; complexity results; give an example
of something; specify the components of a data structure;  
and other such specific questions.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<b>Addressing a question from lecture:</b>
You can offer to answer/address a question/issue that comes in class
that is
<ul>
<li> interesting and relevant to the course material</li>
<li> beyond the material people are responsible for </li>
<li> something I can't immediately answer well </li>
</ul>
In up to two pages plus references, clearly state the question/issue
you are addressing, and write up
a response.  
Email your response to me.  Acceptable answers plus comments
will be posted for other students to read (you can decide if
you want to include your name).   For an unacceptable response, I'll send
comments to the author about why I find it unacceptable.  There is no
penalty for an unacceptable response.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<b> Course Schedule:</b>
There is a <A  HREF="schedule.shtml">schedule </A> on 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~wiebe/courses/CS2710/Fall2015">
the course web page.
</A>
The schedule includes topics, lecture notes, due dates, 
assignments, specific reading assignments,
and exam dates. 
It will be updated as the course
proceeds.  

<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<b> Academic Misconduct: </b>
Assignments must be your own individual work.
<br><br>

You must do the work without undue help from other people, and you
must
not present material from resources such as the Web, books, papers,
previous classes, or
other people as your own.  
You may talk to each other about concepts and techniques, but you must
not discuss specific solutions or approaches to solutions.
