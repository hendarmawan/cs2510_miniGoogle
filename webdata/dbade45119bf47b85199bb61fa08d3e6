<title>HYPERTEXT, HTML and XML</title>

<h1>HYPERTEXT, HTML and XML</h1>

<b>Hypertext</b> is based on the concept of 
"Expanding Information". 
<br><br>
Blocks of information (text or graphics)
can be linked to other blocks of
information.
<br><br>
Once two blocks of information have been
linked together, they provide an instant
"gateway" to the other.
<br><br>
A single block of information can lead to
another and so on.  Information can literally
expand at the user's request.  
<br><br>
A hypertext document is a NONLINEAR
document with many links.
<h3>FATHER OF HYPERTEXT</h3>

Vannevar Bush, "As We May Think" (1933),
described the Memex Machine:
<br><br>
"One might have the contents of a thousand
volumes located in a couple of cubic feet
in a desk, so that by depressing a few
keys one could have a given page instantly
projected before him."

<h1>HYPERTEXT CONCEPTS </h1>

<b>Link Originator</b> - The starting point
to the link.  It is surrounded by the
symbols to indicate that it is a  hypertext
link. Link originator is an <b>anchor</b>.
<br><br>
<b>Link End</b> - The other side to a Link
originator, where reader is taken after a link
is traversed. Link end is also an <b>anchor</b>.
<br><br>
<b>Traverse</b> - The act of traveling from
a Link originator to its associated
Link End.

<h1>INTERNET</h1>
The growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web is truly phenomenal.
<br><IMG SRC="images/fig151.gif"><br>
<h2>Internet Concepts</h2>

The following are commonly used application layer protocols:

<li> HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol<br>
<li> FTP File Transfer Protocol<br>

<br>
TCP Transmission Control Protocol is at Transport Layer<br>
<br>
IP Internet Protocol is at Internetwork Layer<br>
<br>
For modem connection there are two commonly used protocols:

<li> SLIP Serial Line Internet Procotol<br>
<li> PPP Point-to-Point Protocol<br>
<br>

IP address: contains sufficient information to uniquely
identify a network and a specific computer on the network.
<br><br>

IP address contains Class ID, Net ID and Host ID<br>
For example, nova.ksi.edu has IP address 192.217.188.1
<pre>
 11000000.11011001.1011110.00000001
 ^^^----- -------- ------- ********
  First 3 bits 110 indicates Class C
  Next 21 bits is Net ID
  Last 8 bits is Host ID
</pre>

<h1>HTML CONCEPTS</h1>
<b>Hyptertext</b>: Test with links to other texts
<br><br>
<b>Home Page</b>: The root of a hypertext structure
<br><br>
<b>Web Browser</b>: A tool to retrieve a document using URL
from the Web server, interpret its HTML and present it to the user
<br><br>
<b>URL</b>: Universal Resource Locator, the "address" of a Web page
<br><br>
<b>HTML</b>: Hypertext Markup Language is the language to design the Web page
<br><br>
<b>Tag</b>: HTML essentially is made up out of tags, which are strings
enclosed in angular brackets.
<pre>
&lt HTML&gt
&lt HEAD&gt
&lt TITLE&gtSample HTML document&lt /TITLE&gt
&lt /HEAD&gt
&lt BODY&gt
&lt H3&gtSample HTML document&lt /H3&gt
&lt A HREF="http://www.ksi.edu/"&gt KSI Graduate School of Computer Science&lt /A&gt
&lt FORM METHOD="get" ACTION="http://www.webbase.com/docs/webbase/examples/getname.htf"&gt
Please enter the name to search for: &lt INPUT NAME="name" SIZE=15 VALUE="Denny"&gt
&lt INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT value="Enter"&gt&lt /FORM&gt
&lt /BODY&gt
&lt /HTML&gt
</pre>



The above HTML form as seen by the user looks like this:

<hr noshade width="75%">
<h3>Sample HTML document</h3>
<a href="http://www.ksi.edu/"> KSI Graduate School of Computer Science</a>
<FORM METHOD="get" ACTION="http://www.webbase.com/docs/webbase/examples/getname.htf">
Please enter the name to search for: <INPUT NAME="name" SIZE=15 VALUE="Denny">
<INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT value="Enter"></FORM> 
<hr noshade width="75%">
<P>
If you click the <b>ENTER</b> button,
this will send a "GET" request to the server that looks like:
<P><UL>
<TT><B>    http://www.WebBase.com/docs/webbase/examples/getname.htf?name=Denny</B></TT>
<P></UL>

The server passes the information, which is a long string called
the Query_String containing the (name,value) pairs, to:
 http://www.WebBase.com/docs/webbase/examples/getname.htf.
<br><br>
This form 'getname.htf' takes the Query_String as input and returns another
form  which is then presented to the user.
<br><br>
This technique of passing information to the server is used by the
<a href="16cgi.html">common gateway interface</a> CGI to perform tasks using CGI scripts (programs).
It is also used by <a href="17webase.html">WebBase</a> to pass information to the WebBase form (<b>htf</b>)
to perform database retrieval/update operations.

<h1>COMPARISON OF DATABASE AND HYPERBASE</h1>

Hyperbase supports:
<br><br>
* Non-linear text<br>
* Information expansion<br>
* Information navigation
<br><br>
The Difference between Database and Hyperbase:
<pre>
HYPERBASE            DATABASE
---------            --------
arbitory link        predefined index

irregularity         regularity (all the record
                     has same attributes)

good for navigation  good for data processing &
& exploration        information processing

easy to handle       more difficult to handle
exceptions           exceptions

User may get lost    User must formulate queries
in hyperspace        to retrieve information and
(disorientation)     may not find what he does not
                     know
</pre>

<h1>A GRAPH-THEORETIC MODEL FOR HYPERBASE</h1>

A hyperbase Hg is an ordered triple (N,A,L)
where
<br><br>
N = {N1,...,Nm} is a set of information
    nodes
<br><br>
A = {Al1,...,Amn} is a set of anchors, or
    subregions within nodes, such that
    each node Ni has one or more
    anchors {Ai1, ..., Ain}
<br><br>
L = &lt Aij, Akl&gt is a set of links or
    ordered pair of anchors.
<br><br>
<h3>Browsing Operator:</h3>
A function mapping a link's first anchor
(link originator) to a link's second
anchor (link end0
<br><br>
<h3>Authoring Operator:</h3>
defines a link by identifying its two
anchors.

<hr>
<h1>LOST IN HYPERSPACE</h1>

A hyperbase becomes very complex because
it has many nodes and links
<br><br>
To solve the problem, we can try to
cluster the nodes and/or links to
form more abstract structures
<br><br>
Aggregate: A set of distinct concepts
that taken together form a more abstract
concept.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Aggregate Clustering with Exceptions ACE:
<br><br>
From the input hypertext graph, construct
an aggregated E-R diagram (regularity)
and an exception graph (irregularity)

<h1>XML, WML AND VRML</h1>

In addition to HTML, we now have
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/231/XML/p0.html"> eXtensible Markup Language XML</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/231/projects/WML/5131.htm"> Wireless Markup Languages WML</a>, and
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/231/projects/VRML/vrml-1.html"> Virtual Reality Markup Language VRML</a>.
These are for standardization of vraious markup languages for
semantic information, wireless applications and virtual
reality applications.
