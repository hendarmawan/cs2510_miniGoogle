<LI>  Most of the <b>patterns</b> in this language started out as <b>observations about "things which worked well" </b>in a particular pattern or 
language 
being 
reviewed in a <b>PLoP-95 writer's workshop</b>. <br><br>
<LI> In the months which followed PLoP'95, many of these <b>patterns</b> were made available to practitioners conducting pattern writing courses, 
and the feedback to the authors indicates that they have been very helpful. <br><br>
<LI> In addition, these <b>patterns</b> were reviewed extensively at PLoP-96 and became part of the working vocabulary of several review groups. 
<br><br>
<b>As a Note ....</b><br><br>
<LI> there is <b>no</b> single right way to write <b>patterns</b>.<br><br> 
<LI>this <b>pattern language </b>describes and demonstrates a collection of writing 
practices 
which have been observed to be particularly effective. The language is targeted at both <b>novice and experienced pattern writers</b>: novices 
may choose to treat these patterns as suggestions to be tried and to be adopted where they help, experts can use these patterns as a form 
of checklist, helping them keep in mind some of the issues and forces in effective pattern writing. <br><br> 
<LI> Unlike a prescriptive pattern language, which describes the steps or recipes for solving some problem, this <b>pattern language</b> 
describes the desired result.<br><br> 
<LI> The <b>pattern author</b> is free to employ different techniques to achieve these results. This approach should
allow this<b> pattern language </b>to be employed in whole or in part as the reader sees fit. <br><br>
