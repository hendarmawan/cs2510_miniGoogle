<h4>Why use HIPR2?</H4>
<h4>According to the authors of HIPR2, the Image Library is one of the biggest 
  reasons for using HIPR2 rather than other sources is the image library:</H4>
<h4><font color="#FF0000">&quot;One of the major reasons for using HIPR is the 
  fact that every image processing operation described in the package is extensively 
  illustrated using good quality on-line digitized images. Viewing these images 
  on a computer screen gives a much more realistic impression of what real image 
  processing is like than is provided by looking at typical pictures in image 
  processing textbooks.&quot;</font> </H4>

  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Another reason is the <font color="#FF0000">balanced overview</font> of the 
  field that the authors give. Although all these processes could be found by 
  using a search engine, and processed with Adobe Photoshop, the novice or intermediate 
  student would have an uneven education: some fields would be covered extensively, 
  while others would have been omitted. Although Photoshop could do most of these 
  image processing tasks, the well-organized approach (in order of difficulty, 
  with major fields categorized, and common names aligned with the proper processes) 
  is highly favorable to an overall understanding of the field. Showing the processing 
  of <font color="#FF0000">images over time</font> also adds an ability usually 
  not found in image processing software: easily preserving before and after imagery, 
  with labels automatically attached. &quot;Students can compare the output of 
  their own image processing package's operators with the example output images 
  included with HIPR to see how different implementations differ slightly in functionality.&quot; 
</h4>
<h4>Besides their major contributions of organization and imagery, <font color="#FF0000">interactive 
  queries </font>(later) are perhaps the most striking and valuable part of this 
  package. If they ever become available for personal use, its recommended to 
  look into acquiring them.</h4>
<h4><font color="#FF0000">Clear explanations</font>, and previously <font color="#FF0000">written 
  instructional materials</font> will help the <font color="#0080FF">teacher</font>, 
  while the ability to play with different processing techniques in a variety 
  of compositions and order should speed the <font color="#0080FF">student</font>'s 
  <font color="#FF0000">progress and engagement in this subject</font>. &quot;...experiment 
  with the effect of changing parameters to operators to see how this changes 
  the output. Suggestions of interesting things to try are given in the student 
  exercises section of many of the worksheets.&quot; Added extras round out the 
  field, with <font color="#FF0000">glossary, bibliography, <font color="#000000">and 
  </font>links.</font></h4>
<h4><font color="#000000">Disadvantage: this could have been done another way 
  using HTML and your own image processing software/ knowledge. Still, it saves 
  time. </font></h4>
