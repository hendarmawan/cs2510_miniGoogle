<b>Introduction</b><br>
The Unified Modeling Language(UML) is an object-oriented analysis and design that evolved as a result of the combined work of James Rumbaugh, Grady Booch, and Ivar Jacobson.  In 1997, a UML consortium(which include Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Oracle, MCI Systemhouse, IBM, IntelliCorp and more) submitted the 1.1 version of the UML to the Object Management Group(OMG).  Since then, UML has become a de facto standard in the software industry, and it continues to evolve.

<b>UML</b><br>
- consists of a number of graphical elements that combine to form diagrams<br>
- describes <u>what</u> the system is supposed to do, doesn't tell <u>how</u> to implement the system
