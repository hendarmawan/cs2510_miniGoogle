<h3>CS 1635 Group 4</h3>
We are interested in the two scenes which depict our hero fighting on a rooftop of the burning city.  However, our group will focus on developing scenario six, namely the second fight between our hero and the snakemen.  In this scene, the snakemen will be on-screen, while the actor plays the hero in the foreground.  As the snakemen advance towards the hero, he will repel then by using various attacks.  These different attacks will register different on-screen reactions (possibly in the snakemen themselves or in the scenery).  The scenario is ended once the hero reaches the safety valve.
