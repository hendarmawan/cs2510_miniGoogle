Test Plan

1. Purpose: This test plan is to test a computer calendar system for
   distance learning, DLS.

2. Unit Testing

 2.1. Calendar module: This module maintains the calendar.
 2.1.1. Equivalance classes for calendar module:
  2.1.1.1. The equivalence classes for item "date":
   1. mm/dd/yy     acceptable
   2. anything else   error
  2.1.1.2. The equivalance classes for item "event-name":
   1. string of less than 8 alphanumeric characters    acceptable
   2. string of longer than 7 alphanumeric characters  error
  .....
 2.1.2. Checklist: The following black-box tests will be performed.
    (   ) Insert a new calendar entry.
    (   ) Modify an existing calendar entry.
    (   ) Delete an existing calendar entry.
    (   ) Create a new DLS.  Insert a few calendar entries.
    (   ) Save DLS.  Re-open to verify save is correct.
    ......

 2.2. Search module: This module searches the calendar.
 2.2.1. Equivalence classes: .....
 2.2.2. Checklist: The following black-box tests will be performed.
    (   ) Search for a calendar entry in a DLS.
    (   ) Search for a calendar entry in all DLSs.
    (   ) Traverse a link from one calendar page to open another calendar page.

Your table of tests should look like the following:
======================================================================================
| test no | description | input | expected output | date tested | problem | solution |
|____________________________________________________________________________________|
| test 2  | unit test   | dates | error message   |             |         |          |
| WhiteBox| user login  | in WD | displayed       |             |         |          |
|____________________________________________________________________________________|
| test 15 | func test   | event | new calendar is |             |         |          |
| BlackBox|  new event  | in ED | displayed       |             |         |          |
|____________________________________________________________________________________|
| test304 | system test | power |  initial window |             |         |          |
| BlackBox|             | up    |  appears        |             |         |          |
======================================================================================

Notes: (1) WD is the equivalence class for Wrong Dates.
       (2) ED is the equivalence class for Event Data.
       (3) There should be hundreds of tests for unit testing.
           This table of tests follow the Test Plan.
       (4)You can add dividing lines in bold face between tests
       for different modules so that it is easy to see the groups.
       (5) One group of tests must be using white-box testing technique.
