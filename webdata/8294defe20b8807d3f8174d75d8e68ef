 Prof Chang,  I am currently doing work with the following projects.  I think
 they could help the VC.
 
 
 http://openrules.com  - Rule engine for Decision Support Systems.  Very
 nice.  Not sure if you need a rules engine for your work but this appears to
 be a great tool.  The new JSR-94 spec from Sun/BEA is for rules engines.
 This project is JSR-94 compliant.  It's an emerging technology
 
 http://eclipsewiki.editme.com/RichClientPlatform -- This is state of the art
 in Java GUI's.  You get the whole Eclipse platform API minus the IDE
 components.  Ends up being a great framework for GUI's.
 
 http://www.springframework.org/ - State of the art server side code
 development framework.  Many benefits for project
 
 http://activemq.codehaus.org/ - Not using directly at work but it could
 benefit the VC

 So,  the  implemention  of  the 
 teacher  tool  will  use  Java.

 What  should  be  the  SMTP  server   
 IP  and  port  be?
[Ed Pavlak]
yes
[sk chang]
 Regarding  the  message  server,   
 John,  can  we  adopt  your   
example?
 I'm  wondering  just  how  to  make  that   
possible
[sk chang to Xin Li in private]
 I  use  teacher  tool  3.0  and  SMTP   
 server  smtp.pitt.edu  and  port  25,     
 and  was  in  a  totally  different   
classroom.
[john menke]
 The  messaging  example  only   
 shows  the  basics  of   
 serializing/deserializing  XML   
messages
[xin li to sk chang in private]
 server:  smtp.pitt.edu 
 port  is  25   
 It  is  only  used  for  teacher  tool  send  group   
emails.
I
[john menke]
 Xin  had  mentioned  more  robust   
 messaging  similar  to  what  JMS   
offers
[xin li to sk chang in private]
 We  have  another  VC  server  for  testing  at   
 bach.cs.pitt.edu,  maybe  you  connect    that   
one??
[sk chang to Xin Li in private]
 So  it  should  have  no   
 consequence.    Now  I  use  student   
 tool  3.0  and  it  works  fine.    If  I  use 
 teacher  tool  3.0  I  got  into  a  older 
 version  of  the  classroom.
[john menke]
 this  is  what  ActiveMQ  offers
[xin li]
 John,  Did  you  ever  do  some  experiments  on   
 Active  MQ?
[john menke]
 I  was  hoping  to  but  work  is  moving  me  towards   
 Eclipse  RCP  and  and  a  project  using  JSR-94  (   
 a  rules  engine)
[sk chang to Xin Li in private]
 John:  Chris  Santamaria  today   
 gave  a  seminar  on  SOAP  and   
 surveyed  AXIS,  and  came  out  in   
 favor  of  AXIS.    Maybe  we  stay  with   
AXIS?
[john menke]
 I  think  Suresh  had  mentioned  he  had  some   
 messaging  experience.    I  was  hoping  he   
 would  participate
[sk chang]
 John:    Chris    Santamaria    today       
   gave    a    seminar    on    SOAP    and     
    
   surveyed    AXIS,    and    came    out

 with       
AXIS?
[sk chang]
 Suresh's  wife  is  expecting.... 
 So  he  could  not  come.
[john menke]
 Ah  i  will  have  to  congratulate  him  then
[john menke]
 ActiveMQ  has  Axis  support
[sk chang]
 Okay.    dan  lyker,  will  you  agree  to   
 take  up  ActiveMQ  as  your   
 seminar  topic  to  study  it?
[dan lyker]
 SInce  this  seems  to  be  the   
 direction  we  need  to  go  I  can  do   
 this  as  the  seminar  topic
[john menke]
 But  as  Axis  is  Webservice  tool  ActiveMQ  is  a   
 full  blown  messaging  tool  -  it  supports  queues   
 and  pub/sub  messaging
[sk chang]
 Thanks,  Dan.
[dan lyker]
 I  have  not  used  it,  is  it  effective  in   
 creating  web  services...  I  have   
 created  many  web  services  in  the   
 .NET  framework,  is  it  similar?
[john menke]
http://activemq.codehaus.org
[xin li]
 I  hope  I  had  attended  chris's  seminar.  I  won't   
 miss    the  following  ones.  :-)
[john menke]
 From  my  understanding  Axis  is  for   
 webservices.    But  Webservices  are  not   
 messaging.  JMS  is  Java  Messaging  and   
 ActiveMQ  is  an  open  source  JMS  server
[sk chang]
 Axis  is  in  public  domain,  is   
 ActiveMQ  also  in  public  domain?
[john menke]
yes
[Christopher Garman]
xin: chris's slides are at http://www.pitt.edu/~cjsst55
[john menke]
http://activemq.codehaus.org/Axis+Support
[sk chang]
 sounds  very  intersting.    Xin,  I  will   
 put  Chirs  Santamaria's  slides  on   
 the  course  website.
[dan lyker]
 I  will  have  to  look  into  this
[sk chang]
 Okay,  I  think  we  have  good   
 discussion  tonite.
[dan lyker]
 This  has  been  very  helpful
[sk chang]
 Rupa,  if  you  like,  please  study  with   
 Dan  together.    This  must  be   
 something  useful  for  you  to  learn   
 as  well.
[john menke]
 Dan,  I  would  be  glad  to  help  with  any   
 information  i  can  provide
[Rupa Natarajan]
 sure  Dr.Chang,  I'll  take  a  look  at  it  too
[sk chang]
 John,  thanks  a  lot.    With  your   
 industry  experience,  we  can  learn   
 a  lot  from  you,  but  we  will  stay  with   
 public  domain  tools  to  avoid   
 licensing    problems.
[dan lyker]
 thanks  john  I  will  have  to  study  up   
 on  activemq  before  i  will  have  any   
questions
[sk chang]
 Okay,  before  I  summarize,  does   
 any  one  have  any  questions  to   
 John  or  others?
[john menke]
 ActiveMQ  has  support  for  Spring.    I  would   
 keep  an  eye  on  that  also.    Search  google  for   
 Spring  Framework
[Ed Pavlak]
no questions from me for now
[sk chang to Xin Li in private]
 XIn,  I  tried  teacher  tool  again.    The   
 selection  menu  ash  "golen  age"  in   
 it.    Is  this  a  clue?
[Rupa Natarajan]
 no  questions
[sk chang]
 Good.    Ed  and  Chris  please  work   
 together  with  Anna.    I  would  like  to   
 talk  to  the  three  of  you  again  next   
 week  (perhaps  Thursday)  to  see   
 how  the  three  of  you  fit  together.
[Christopher Garman]
ok sounds good
[sk chang]
 Xin  can  show  you  how  the  current   
 version  of  teacher  tool  works.    SO   
 let  us  (plus  Xin)  meet  right  after   
 class  on  Thursday.
[xin li to sk chang in private]
 I  will  check  the  server  tomorrow  to  see  if  there  is   
 multiple  servers  on  adam.
[Ed Pavlak]
works for me
[xin li]
OK
[sk chang]
 Rupa  and  Dan  will  study   
 ActiveMQ,  and  Axois  (check  Chris   
 santamaria  notes).    And  if  you   
 have  qustions,  talk  to  John  by   
e-mail.
[Rupa Natarajan]
 ok  Dr.  Chang
[dan lyker]
ok
[john menke]
 yes  please  do  i  will  be  glad  to  help
[sk chang]
 Okay.    John,  thanks  again. 

 I  think  we  can  call  it  a  night.    Good   
 bye  everybody.
[john menke]
 Bye  all
[Ed Pavlak]
goodnight
[Rupa Natarajan]
 good  night
[xin li]
 bye  all
[Christopher Garman]
bye all
[Rupa Natarajan]
