<b>Course Description:</b>
This course is one of the <a href="../SEtrack.htm">graduate courses in software engineering</a>.
This course covers the fundamentals of visual language
theory, iconic and symbolic representations, parsing
techniques, semantics and pragmatics of visual
languages, visual programming systems, visual querying
systems, visual information systems and visual software engineering.

There has been growing research interest
in visual languages and visual programming.  Its applications are
diverse: visual user interface, visual specifications, visual reasoning, visual database
systems and multimedia computing, to name but a few.  This course will
prepare the student to pursue research in these new and
exciting fields of theory and application of visual languages.

<!--
We will concentrate on UML as the visual
language for software specification, design
and reuse.  In recent years, UML has emerged as
the unified visual language for software
engineering.  We will study
UML and the many proposed extensions and
research results in extending/formalizing/utilizing
UML.  Modern visual language theory is explored
in the context of UML applications.

<p><a href="365syl.html"> <b>Course Outline: </b></a> 
An <a href="vail/t01.htm">introductory lecture</a> provides
the background, theory and applcation of visual languages.

<p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b>  The student is expected to be familiar
with programming languages, operating systems, and has some knowledge of computer
graphics and compiler design.

<b>Grading:</b>

<br>
The student is expected to complete four milestones <!-- exercises --> (20%), take one midterm (25%),
give one seminar based upon selected papers and technical reports (15%),
and do a project and make a project presentation/demonstration (40%).
<!-- For each presentation, another student will be selected to be
the discussant, whose job is to criticize the approach.
The project report should be made available, to the instructor and the discussant, one week prior to presentation. -->
<a href="grade/grade.html">Grades</a> can be found on-line.
A <a href="club.html">bulletin board</a> is available for interaction among students and the instructor.

<b>Term Project:</b>

<!--
We will focus on personal digital assistant for distributed multimedia systems
as a general theme.
Then a topic can be chosen based upon your interest:
(a) Implementation of visual interface, visual database and visual programming tools for PDA.
(b) Theoretical topics related to the syntactic and semantic theory of icons, active indexing, the theory of visual languages.

We will focus on the virtual classroom
as a general theme.
Then a topic can be chosen based upon your interest:
(a) Implementation of visual interface, visual database and visual programming tools for the virtual classroom.
(b) Theoretical topics related to the syntactic and semantic theory of icons, active indexing, the theory of visual languages.

(c) Visual specification and transformations for rapid prototyping.

<p>
<b>Unique Features of this course:</b>
We will use the Web extensively for this course.  The class notes will be
available on the Web.  The exercises and take-home mid-term examination
are also available on the Web.
Students are encouraged to turn in exercises, mid-term examination by
e-mail, give the seminar by developing a Web-based visual/multimedia
presentation, and give the project demo/presentation the same way.
There will also be a single project theme: the <a h ref="senmap/senmapA.htm"><b>virtual classroom</b></a>.
More details about the virtual classroom will be provided in class.
