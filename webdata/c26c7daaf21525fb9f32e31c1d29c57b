<h2>Scope</h2>
The Journal of Visual Languages & Computing (JVLC) is
intended  to  be  a forum for researchers, practitioners and
developers to exchange ideas and research results,  for  the
advancement  of visual languages and visual
computing.  JVLC  publishes  research  papers,  state-of-the-art
surveys,  review  articles,  in the areas of visual
languages, visual computing, visual programming, visual  human-machine  interface
design,  visual  communication, multi-media communications,
pictorial databases,  pictorial  information  systems,
information  retrieval  systems  & algorithms, cognitive
aspects of human-machine systems,  biological  vision  systems
and models, visualization of system design, visualization of
computational processes, large-scale  scientific  computing,
and  parallel/distributed/neural computing & representations
for visual information processing.  Papers are also  welcome
to  report  on actual use, experience, transferred technologies
in visual programming, visual computing,  and  advanced  applications  in
geographic information systems, pictorial archiving and
communication systems, library information systems,  biomedical
imagery,   industrial  automation,  computer  animation  and
computer-assisted visual arts.
Book reviews and tool reviews, not to exceed four pages, can also be submitted
to the book reviews editor and tools reviews editor, respectively.

<h2>Submission of Manuscripts</h2>
Manuscripts may be  submitted  electronically, or in hard copies, to
either  Editor through our editorial office in London.   Original  papers  only will be considered.
Book reviews may be submitted to the book reviews editor, and
tool reviews may be submitted to the tool reviews editor.
Manuscripts are accepted for review with  the  understanding
that  the  same  work  has  not  been and will not be nor is
presently submitted elsewhere, and that its  submission  for
publication  has  been approved by all of the authors and by
the institution where the work  was  carried  out;  further,
that any person cited as a course of personal communications
has approved such citation.  Written  authorization  may  be
required at the Editor's discretion.  Articles and any other
material published in JVLC represent  the  opinions  of  the
author(s)  and  should not be construed to reflect the
opinions of the Editor(s) and the Publisher.

<p>
<h2>Form of Manuscript</h2>
Four copies of the manuscript  including
the  original  (reproductions  are  acceptable  if  they are
clearly legible) and copies of all figures are required.  In
addition,  one  reproducible  set of figures (professionally
drafted ink originals of line  drawings;  glossy  prints  of
halftones  will  be  required  if  the  paper  is  accepted.
Manuscripts should be typewritten, double-spaced on one side
of  8.5  X  11  in  white paper with 1 inch margins.  Page 1
should   contain   the   article   title,   author(s),   and
affiliation(s); and the name and complete mailing address of
the person to whom correspondence should be sent.  Any
footnotes  to  the  title  (indicated  by  *, +, etc.) should be
placed at the bottom of page 1.  Page  2  should  contain  a
short abstract (100-150 words).
<p>
<h3>List of Symbols</h3>
The manuscript should contain a list of all
symbols  used in the paper.  They should be identified
typographically for the printer, not mathematically.  This  list
will  not  appear in print, but is essential to avoid costly
corrections in proof.
<p>
<h3>Footnotes</h3>
Text footnotes should be avoided whenever  
possible.   If  they  must  be used, indicate them by superscript
numbers in the text, and type them all  double-spaced  on  a
separate page.
<p>
<h3>Equations</h3>
Equations should be typewritten and with the  number  placed
in  parentheses at the right margin.  Reference to the
equations should use the form "Eq.  (3)" or simply (3).
<p>
<h3>References</h3>
References should be indicated in the  text  by  numbers  in
square brackets and listed at the end of the paper in
numerical order; they should be typed double-spaced on a separate
page.  Style and punctuation of references must be in
accordance with the following examples:
<p>
     1.  T. Y. Kong and A. W. Roscoe, Continuous analogs  of
axiomated  digital  surfaces.  Comput. Vision Graphics Image
Process 29, 1985, 60-86.
<p>
     2.   R. M. Haralick, edge and region analysis for digital
image  data  in  Image Modeling (A. Rosenfeld, Ed), pp.
171-184, Academic Press, New York, 1981.
<p>
     3.   R. A. Schowengerdt, Techniques for Image  Processing
and  Classification  in Remote Sensing, Academic Press,
New York, 1983.
<p>
Reports should not be  cited  unless  absolutely  necessary.
Tables  should  be  umbered with Arabic numerals in order of
appearance in the text.  They should be typed  double-spaced
on  separate pages.  Each table should have a short descriptive
caption.  Table  footnotes  (indicated  by  superscript
lower-case letters) should be typed at the end of the table.
Figures should be numbered in order of appearance (with
Arabic  numerals)  and  should have short descriptive captions.
Line drawings must be professionally drafted  originals,  in
black ink, with lettering large enough to be legible after a
reduction of 50-60%.  Photographs must be glossy prints.  No
figures  should exceed 8.5 x 11 inch in size; they should be
designed to fit the proportions of the  printed  page.   All
figures  should  have  captions  typed  double-spaced  on  a
separate sheet.  Illustrations in color can be accepted only
if the authors defray the cost.

<p>
Elsevier now requires that all manuscripts submitted to its journals be accompanied by a
signed <a href="ijvlc.copy.html">copyright transfer agreement (html file)</a>. You will find the <a href="images/copyright.gif">copyright transfer agreement (gif file)</a> in the back of each issue

<p>
Under the terms of the U.S. copyright law effective January 1, 1978, and the copyright laws
of many other countries, journal publishers are required to obtain written confirmation from authors
in order to acquire copyright rights for papers published in their journals. We are therefore asking
you to sign and return the applicable section of the accompanying form. If you and your co-authors,
if any, own rights in your paper as individuals, please sign Section A of the attached form. If you
work for a corporation that owns the rights in the paper, please have an authorized officer of the

No manuscript will be processed until the appropriate form has been returned.
<p>
We ask your cooperation because it is of vital importance for the widest possible
dissemination of your paper and the continued viability of our journal. We must have your written
confirmation in order to authorize libraries and other information centers to use this material and to
perform other appropriate publishing functions.

written request, Elsevier will promptly return the rights to the manuscript to the author(s).
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Note that Elsevier may choose to publish an abstract or portions of
the paper prior to publishing the paper in the journal. Please contact Elsevier immediately
if you would like Elsevier to refrain from such prior publication for any reason, including
disclosure of a patentable invention.
