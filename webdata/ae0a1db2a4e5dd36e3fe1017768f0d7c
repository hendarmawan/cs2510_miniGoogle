<P align=left>It is the <STRONG>user</STRONG> who should 
bring the adaptivity to the man-machine hypermedia system. Different users can 
adapt the system to their specific information needs.</P>
<P align=left><IMG align=center src="fig3.jpg"></P>
<H3 align=left><U>Educational hypermedia systems</U>  </H3>
<P align=left>Small <EM>hyperspaces</EM> representing a particular course 
or section of learning material on a particular subject.</P>
<P align=left>The <EM>goal</EM> of the 
student is usually to learn all this material or a reasonable part of it. The 
hypermedia form supports <EM>student-driven</EM>          
            
acquisition of the learning material. </P>
<P align=left>The most important <EM>user feature</EM> in educational hypermedia 
is user knowledge of the subject being taught.</P>
<P align=left>  Problem:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left>First, The knowledge of different users can vary greatly and 
  the knowledge of a particular user can grow quite fast. </DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left>Second, novices enter the hyperspace of educational material 
  knowing almost nothing about the subject--need <EM>navigational</EM> 
  help</DIV></LI></UL>
<H3 align=left><U>On-line information systems</U></H3>
<P align=left><EM>Hyperspace</EM> depends on the subject, its size can range 
from reasonably small to very large. </P>
<P align=left>The <EM>goal</EM> of these systems is to provide reference access 
to information for the users. </P>
<P align=left>The system has to&nbsp;infer or collect&nbsp;the goals of 
users.</P>
<P align=left>Problems:&nbsp;Users with different knowledge and background need 
different information about a concept and at different levels of 
detail--Navigation is important.</P>
<H3 align=left><U>On-line help systems</U></H3>
<P align=left>Usually attached to&nbsp;the application system. </P>
<P align=left><EM>Hyperspace</EM> in existing on-line help systems is reasonably 
small. Navigation is less important than On-line information systems.</P>
<H3 align=left><U>Information Retrieval(IR) hypermedia systems</U></H3>
<P align=left>The size of <EM>hyperspace</EM> in regular IR hypermedia is 
usually very large and can not be structured "by hand".</P>
<P align=left>Search-oriented</P>
<P align=left>Example: WWW</P>
<H3 align=left><U>Institutional information systems</U></H3>
<P align=left>The systems serve on-line all the information required to support 
the work of some institution.</P>
<P align=left>A specific feature of these systems is that they are a medium for 
everyday work of many institution employees. According to their profession they 
may always use only a specific area of hyperspace, and according to the current 
working goal they may need an access to a <EM>very small subset</EM> of it.</P>
<P align=left>Work-oriented</P>
<H3 align=left><U>systems for managing personalized views</U></H3>
<P align=left>Offer huge amount of different information and on-line services 
which form a really <EM>unlimited hyperspace</EM>.</P>
<P align=left>Many users need to have an access to one or more subsets of all 
the hyperspace for their everyday work--need to define personalized views on the 
entire hyperspace.</P>
<P align=left>A new factor is the <EM>dynamic character</EM> of hyperspace where 
items can appear, disappear, or evolve.</P>
<P>
<IMG align=center src="fig4.jpg" > </P>
<P>The hypermedia located in the center are "real hypermedia," and can 
demonstrate all classic hypermedia features: all kinds of links including 
contextual links, indexes, local and global maps, guided tours, etc. The systems 
located at the ends of the continuum use only some of the traditional hypermedia 
features. The relative size of <EM>working subset</EM> decreases gradually from 
top to bottom.</P>
