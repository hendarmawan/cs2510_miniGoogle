Note: DFD diagram is good because of its simplicity.
UML diagrams are bad because of the complexity.  However
UML diagrams are comprehensive and very useful.  UML

Petri Nets are theoretically sound and mathematically
manipulatable, but ugly to the novice and uninitiated.
Petri Net is covered in CS2310.
