<h2>Module</h2>

A strict definition of module is as follows:<p>

<b>A module is a set of one or more contiguous program statements having
a name by which other parts of the system can invoke it, and preferably
having its own distinct set of variable names.  In other words,
<font color=red>
a module consists of a single block of code that can be invoked
in the way that a procedure, function, or method is invoked. </b> (Stevens, Myers and Constantine)
</font>

<p>
A more general definition of module is as follows:<p>

<b>A module is a lexically contiguous sequence of program statements,
bounded by boundary elements, having an aggregate identifier."</b>

Procedures and functions are modules.  An object is a module, and
so is a method within an object.
