Dear CS2310 Student working on K1 or K2 or other things:

1. Please send me ppt file of your seminar presentation
before your presentation so I can upload it.

2. Regarding your project for K1 or K2,
the details are for you to specify and design.
I will describe the common elements here:

2.1. You are supposed to check and make sure the
Kinect monitor component works correctly
in the SIS framework. So the compnent will collect data
from sensors, check certain conditions and send alert
messages to Uploader.

You will do program development and testing using your
own PC that runs the SIS you have installed.  Whenever
you find that you lack certain input, use PrjRemote.exe
to generate the needed messages.

2.2. The starting point is always the following document:
  http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/interface/SequenceSIS.htm

Please read the above document carefully, and make
sure you understand it.

Please note all system messages are specified at:
  http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/163/interface/MessageSIS.htm

2.3. You need to add a message 20 to create the 
Kinect monitor component.  This is to enable SIS
server to know that Kinect
monitor component exist.  If Kinect monitor already
exists, check whether such message 20 exists and
works properly.  

2.4. When system gets started, a message 23 is used
to connect a component to the SIS server.
The existing script may already be doing that.
Check it out.

2.5. Kinect component should
run the undergrad's FallDetect's code, and when
condition is satisfied, send message 38
to SIS.

=============
This is a checklist for the testing of the
Kinect monitor component.


( ) The GUI/InputProcessor is an SIS component

( ) The submenu to select options for Kinect
    is part of the GUI component

( ) After options for Kinect have been selected,
    a message containing the parameters is sent
    by GUI compoment to the Kinect monitor

( ) The Kinect monitor is an SIS component

( ) The Kinect monitor contains the codes for
    the detection of "patient fall"
    and other special conditions by applying
    the FallDetect algorithm, whose details are in:
    http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/FallDetect.zip

( ) If a special condition is detected, the Kinect
    monitor sends a warning message 38 to SIS,
    which should forward it to the Uploader component.

( ) The Uploader component receives the warning message
    38 from the Kinect monitor and then sends
    e-mail to the end-user.

( ) The Uploader component also stores the Kinect
    information in the online PatientHealth database.


In addition to the above basic checklist, for K2
there will be additional checks:

(  ) In addition to detection of Fall, you can add
your own algorithm(s) to the Kinect Monitor component,
so that it can detect other conditions, for example,
the patient is motionless, the patient is nowhere to
be found, and so on.  The appropriate warning message
38 should be generated.
