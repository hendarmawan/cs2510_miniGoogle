<LI><u>CONTEXT :</u>  You are an experienced practitioner in your field. You have noticed that you keep using a certain <b>solution</b> to a commonly 
occurring <b>problem</b>. You would like to share your experience with others. <br><br>
<LI><u> PROBLEM </u>:  How do you share a recurring <b>solution</b> to a <b>problem</b> with others so that it may be reused? <br><br>
<LI> <u> FORCES :</u>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <UL TYPE = circle> <LI>Keeping the <b>solution</b> to yourself doesn't require any effort <br><br></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<BLOCKQUOTE> <UL TYPE = circle> <LI> Sharing the <b>solution</b> verbally helps a few others but won't make a big impact in your field. 
<br><br></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <UL TYPE = circle> <LI> Writing down your understanding of the <b>solution</b> is hard work and requires much reflection on how you solve 
the problem. <br><br></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <UL TYPE = circle> <LI> Transforming your specific <b>solution</b> into a more widely applicable solution is difficult. 
<br><br></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <UL TYPE = circle> <LI> People are unlikely to use a <b>solution</b> if you don't explain the reasons for using it. <br><br></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <UL TYPE = circle> <LI> Writing down the <b>solution</b> may compromise your competitive advantage (either personal or corporate.) 
<br><br></BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI> <u> SOLUTION :</u> 
<BLOCKQUOTE> <UL TYPE = circle> <LI> Write down the <b>solution</b> using the pattern form.<br><br></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <UL TYPE = circle> <LI> Distribute the resulting pattern to the largest audience you
feel it could help that does not compromise your competitive advantage. Often, this means publishing your patterns 
exclusively within your company via Intranets or company journals.<br><br></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> <u> EXAMPLE :</u><br><br> Entering Sennott Square after 9 p.m. could 
be an example 
of a common problem.
