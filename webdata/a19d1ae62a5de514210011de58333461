Good Afternoon, Professor. Chang
[marius giurgi]
Dr Chang is sleeping?
[sk chang]
 Hi  everybody
[sk chang]
 I  just  finished  talking  to  some  of   
 you  in  one-on-one  meetings.
[Beatriz Maeireizo to sk chang in private]
 Good  afternoon,  Prof.  Chang
[sk chang]
 It  is  good  to  know,  of  the  six   
 studets  I  talked  to  so  far,    two 
 interested  in  netogiation   
 protocols,  two  in  message   
 servers,  one  in  developing  the  VC   
 teacher  tool  Java  version,  and   
 one  in  searcher  and  indexing.
[sk chang]
 So  I  will  continue  to  talk  to  the   
 remaining  students  Thursday  and   
 next  Tuesday.    By  then  we  should   
 have  clusters  of  students   
 interested  in  different  sub-topics.
[sk chang]
 Then  the  clusters  can  meet   
 together  to  discuss  the  various   
 topics.    For  example,  the  interface   
 of  VC  and  remote  control  to   
 message  server  could  really   
 involve  five  or  six  students.
[Audio from christopher santamaria]
ok, that sounds like a good idea
[Beatriz Maeireizo to sk chang in private]
 That  sounds  excellent!
[sk chang]
 We  will  then  have  meetings  so   
 that  everone  can  benefit  and  learn   
 from  one  another.
[sk chang to Marius Giurgi in private]
 I  am  talking  to  you  in  private.    Are   
 you  still  in  this  class?
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
The meeting was quite helpful and a very good idea. We can continue with these in future as well.
[Beatriz Maeireizo to sk chang in private]
 How  much  time  will  we  have  for   
 each  presentation  in  the  seminar?
[sk chang to Marius Giurgi in private]
 Because  you  have  not  turned  in   
 any  of  the  first  three  exercises.
[sk chang to Marius Giurgi in private]
 Probably  half  an  hour  for  the   
presentation.
[sk chang]
 What  I  hope  is  that  the  second  half   
 of  the  course  can  be  more   
 interactive  and  less  formal.    WE   
 all  learn  best  in  small  group   
 discussions.    And  we  can  use  the   
 term  projects  as  focus  points  to   
 stimulate  discussions.
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
I agree.
[Audio from christopher santamaria]
I also agree
[sk chang]
 Any  questions  or  comments?
[Audio from jim clause]
no, it looks pretty straight forward
[Brian Smyth]
None from me, I think I understand the plan.
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
The plan sounds good to me.
[Beatriz Maeireizo]
 I  would  like  to  know  how  will  the   
 seminars  be  held... 
 Wll  they  be  through  VC?  How   
 much  time  per  presentation  will  we   
have?
[ANJANA DIVAKAR]
 i  think  its  quite  clear
[sk chang]
 The  seminars  will  be  about  30   
 minutes  each.    They  will  mostly  be   
 presented  live  at  the  live  class. 

 Please  follow  the  syllabus  to  read   
 the  materials  according  to  our   
 course  schedule.    Next  week   
 when  we  have  live  class,  I  will  give   
 additional  explanation.
[christopher santamaria]
Every thing is clear to me.
[Beatriz Maeireizo]
 Thank  you.
[Ed Pavlak]
Sorry, I logged in a little late and I think I missed the 'plan'
[Ed Pavlak]
can someone give me a quick recap?
[Beatriz Maeireizo]
 I  can  send  you  the  log  of  our  chat...
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
Hi Ed, I can send you the transcript if you want.
[sk chang to Marius Giurgi in private]
 Marius,  see  me  Tuesday  at  4::40 
 pm.  But  you  should  try  to  turn  in   
 exercises,  even  if  it  is  late  it  is   
 better  than  never.
[Ed Pavlak]
that would be great
[sk chang]
 In  fact,  for  those  of  you  interested   
 in  working  on  the  server  or  data   
 miner,  try  to  save  the  transcript   
 and  take  a  look,  so  that  you  know   
 the  format.    Also,  try  to  exercise   
 the  current  version  of  data  miner   
 (available  only  in  Java  version).
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
Ok.
[Audio from Chris Bryant]
 ...can  someone  send  me  a  log  of   
 the  chat  as  well?
[sk chang]
 If  no  more  questions,  we  will  call  it   
 a  day.    THursday  same  deal.    I   
 will  talk  to  some  of  you,  and  then   
 we  have  a  short  wrap-up  at  5pm  in   
 our  VC  meeting.
[Jonathan Misurda]
ok, see you then
[Brian Smyth]
Sounds good.
[christopher santamaria]
ok, talk to you then
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
Ok Chris, I have the log, I can send it to you as well
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
