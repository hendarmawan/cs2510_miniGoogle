<ul>
<li> If we want to find objects that are similar, by what terms do we
define "similarity"?
<P>
<li> Use a <B>Transformation Function</B>
<br> -it can let the user decide what similarities to look for
<br> -we can take these similarities and map objects in attribute space so
     that "like" objects are mapped closer than unlike ones
<P>
<li> Shape Similarity Example
<br> -We want to find objects with little area difference when the two
      objects are place over each other 
    <ul>
    <li> Blur the query point
    <li> Only look at the first k rectangles since these are increasingly
         good approximations of the shapes
    <li> Problems
        <ul>
        - Multiple Representations
        <ul> Possible solutions: store all representations in DB -BIG DB
        <br> at query time, query for all reresentations of the query
             object and take union of these -Longer query time
        </ul>
        - Dimension Mismatch
        <ul> Add Dummy rectangles of size zero
        </ul>

    </ul>
    
    <li> Experiment and Results
