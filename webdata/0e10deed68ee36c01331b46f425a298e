      <p>Unless explicitly noted otherwise, the work in this course
      is to be done independently.  Discussions with other students on
      the assignments should be limited to understanding the statement
      of the problems and discussing general solution
      tactics.  <b>Cheating in any way, including giving your work to
      someone else will result in an F for the course and a report to
      the appropriate University authority.</b>  Submissions that are
      alike in a substantive way will be considered to be cheating by
      ALL involved parties.</p>

      <p>Also, please make sure you read, understand and abide by the
