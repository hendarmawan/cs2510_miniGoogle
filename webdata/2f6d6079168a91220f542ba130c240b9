<li>
So after the Project Manager know that there is a new project for him to
schedule, he can use the TeamCenters resource-related tools,
which are cross-project member assignment view, interactive resource
loading histogram, team creation, and user roles.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
He can get a graph, displaying a calendar view overlaid with the members
daily workload. From that he will know who is work is over loaded.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
For initial scheduling the Project Manager can use TeamCenters drag &amp;
drop Gantt schedule. Dependencies, milestones, start and finish dates are
changed by simply dragging elements in the chart.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
No separate Gantt Charts and Network diagrams.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
Project Manager uses TeamCenters real-time Group Discussions and free-form
Collaborative Notebooks to capture and exchange a wide variety of
information related to teams and their work, including web URLs and
documents.<br>
<BR></li>
</ol>
<b><i><font face="Arial">Microsoft Project Central:</font></i></b><br>

<ol>
<li>
As said above, the Project Manager starts scheduling the resources as soon
as he knows that there is new project. There is no information how he will
know about the resources like who is available and who are good. Probably
that facility is not there.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
Project Managers can build Gannt Charts and it is simple to customize this
view by re-ordering the columns, filtering for specific tasks, and
grouping by project name, start date, or other task characteristics.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
Powerful new features include custom outline codes that allow Project
Manager to create a project outline structure tailored to company's
work<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
He can use task calendars provided by Microsoft Project Central to create 
a
schedule that factors in resource challenges such as scheduling conflicts
or equipment downtime.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
No any other interesting information.</li>
