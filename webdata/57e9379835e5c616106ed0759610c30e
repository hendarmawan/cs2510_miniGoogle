    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000FF">Form interface is not as easy as drag-and-drop:
      </font>&nbsp;You cannot easily drag and drop buttons and images anywhere 
      on the form.&nbsp; Rather they are <font color="#0000FF">placed wherever 
      the cursor starts </font>-- similar to if you are putting an image in a 
      word document, it would place it wherever the cursor is and you couldn't 
      easily move it around in the document unless it was in a
      <font color="#0000FF">clipart frame</font>.&nbsp; Similarly, this is how 
      it works with WebMatrix, so if you want to <font color="#0000FF">move 
      something </font>over just a little bit, you cannot that easily<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li><font color="#0000FF">Things are just not as easy as they are said to 
      be:</font>&nbsp; Before starting on this project, I thought this would be 
      very simple and done very quickly.&nbsp; That is the impression I got from 
      all the online testimonials of <font color="#0000FF">Web Matrix's 
      creators.</font>&nbsp; Only after a couple hours, when I started doing 
      more than just dragging controls onto the forms, I realized how 
      inconvenient this program is.&nbsp; Things you may be able to do using 
      Visual Studios .NET in a matter of a few minutes may take you hours using 
      WebMatrix<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li><font color="#0000FF">No features made for using Microsoft Access:</font>&nbsp; 
      Since I wasn't really using a large database for my project, I thought I 
      will experiment with Microsoft Access instead of <font color="#0000FF">MSDE (Microsoft Data 
      Engine)</font> -- which is a free runtime version of Microsoft SQL Server.&nbsp; 
      However, I soon realized WebMatrix cannot be used to easily view and 
      create databases using <font color="#0000FF">Microsoft Access</font>.&nbsp; Instead you could access a 
      Microsoft Access file, but you would need to code everything and not be 
      able to view the tables or <font color="#0000FF">graphically insert items
      </font>or dynamically build 
      SQL statements to use in your code.&nbsp; This would require knowledge on 
      how create a connection to the database and then access such information<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li><font color="#0000FF">Difficult to install MSDE:&nbsp; </font>If you 
      follow the &quot;simple&quot; step-by-step direction on installing MSDE, you will be 
      quite disappointed because this is a lot more to it than what is stated in 
      simple words.&nbsp; Everything from setting proper <font color="#0000FF">
      permissions in XP t</font>o specifying properties not referred to in the 
      manual, your best resource is hours of filtering through the
      <font color="#0000FF">online forum</font> conversations by other 
      frustrated users</li>
    </ul>
