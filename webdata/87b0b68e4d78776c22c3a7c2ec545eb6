<p>
An important element of the NSF Plant Genome Research Program is to develop
shared resources and research tools that will enable plant genome research to
advance efficiently, rapidly and in a cost-effective manner.  At the Visual Computing Laboratory of the University of Pittsburgh we are
developing a research and education tool that can be used by
scientists to annotate, retrieve and relate plant genomic information.
This plant genome information assistant will be accessible through the Internet
using a browser.  The users - scientists, educators and students - can
place annotated active tags called <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/365/adletfig/s1.html">adlets</a> on important genome data items.  The
plant genome information assistant is able to provide up-to-date, personalized
information to the user.  Moreover these adlets are active and can
travel from node to node, collecting additional information.  The adlets
can be organized hierarchically so that only adlets
in a certain class are active during a user's search.  For example
an expert may want to retrieve information annotated by fellow
scientists only, while a student may want to retrieve information annotated
by teacher, fellow students and expert scientists.
We will explore the prototyping of a plant genome information assistant
for a single plant such as the flowering plant Arabidopsis Thaliana.
The system will be tested by researchers and graduate students
of the University
of Pittsburgh.
