<h2>The problem with distributed applications</h2>

<p><font size="4">It is easy to create a distributed application
within a network. In fact, many technologies are available to do
just that, such as DCOM, Corba, and Sun's RMI. However, there are
major problems when doing so across network boundaries.</font></p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p><font size="4">Security is one of the snafus. Although the
above technologies look good on paper, when it comes to dealing
with inter-network security, they are very hard to work with and
configure. Some even require additional development effort to
work around security barriers. Thus, they do not scale well to
the Internet where security conflicts are beyond the ability to
resolve locally and/or easily.</font></p>

<h3>Tightly coupled producers and consumers</h3>

<p><font size="4">Data producers and consumers are often tightly
coupled together. This implies a homogenous structure to the
producers and consumers involved. This also tends to promote
&quot;brittleness&quot;, wherein a failure may occur due to
changing interfaces on one side breaking something on the other.
Distributing modules across the Internet makes this more likely
since at least one is not necessarily under your control.</font></p>

<h3>The long haul</h3>

<p><font size="4">What happens when a company gets acquired or
goes under? These things happen, and so it is hard to guarantee
the unified infrastructure demanded by DCOM, Corba or RMI. Thus,
there are difficulties scaling these technologies over time.</font></p>
