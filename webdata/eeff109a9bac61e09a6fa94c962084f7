 Q.  How many senior managers does it take to change a light bulb?<br>
 A.  We've formed a task force to study the problem of why light bulbs<br>

 Q.  How many support staff people does it take to change a light bulb?<br>
 A.  We have an exact copy of the light bulb here and it seems to be<br>
     working fine. Can you tell me what kind of system you have?  Ok.<br>
     Just exactly how dark is it?  Ok.  There could be four or five<br>
     things wrong. Have you tried the light switch?<br>
<br>

 Q.  How many Windows programmers does it take to change a light bulb?<br>
 A.  472. One to write WinGetLightBulbHandle, one to write<br>
     WinQueryStatusLightBulb, one to write WinGetLightSwitchHandle...<br>

 Q.  How many C++ programmer's does it take to change a light bulb?<br>
 A.  You're still thinking procedurally.  A properly designed light bulb<br>
     object would inherit a change method from a generic light bulb<br>
     class, so all you'd have to do is send it a bulb change message.<br>
