<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The simulator IC is an IC 
  that would normally not be included in a live system. For purposes of demonstration 
  the simulator IC is included. In a live system this IC would be replaced by 
  an IC representing the system that actually determined the real location of 
  the trains on the track. This may actually be another adaptive system which 
  would be interfaced with the existing one, extending both systems usefulness.</font></p>
