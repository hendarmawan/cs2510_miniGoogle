<LI> <font color="red">Each <b>pattern</b> is a three-part rule, which expresses a relation between a certain context, a problem, and a 
solution. [Alexander]</font><br><br>
<LI> A <b>pattern</b> is the abstraction from a concrete form which keeps recurring in specific non-arbitrary contexts.[Riehle and 
Zullighoven] <br><br>
<LI> A <b>pattern</b> is where theory and practice meet to reinforce and complement one another, by showing that the structure it 
describes is useful, useable, and used![community] <br><br>
<LI> A <b>pattern</b> is a named nugget of instructive information that captures the essential structure and insight of a successful 
family of proven solutions to a recurring problem that arises within a certain context and system of forces. [community]<br><br>
<LI> A <b>pattern</b> is a named nugget of insight that conveys the essence of a proven solution to a recurring problem within a 
certain context amidst competing concerns. [community]<br><br>
<LI> As an element in the world, each <b>pattern</b> is a relationship between a certain context, a certain system of forces which 
occurs 
repeatedly in that context, and a certain spatial configuration which allows these forces to resolve themselves.[Gabriel] <br><br>
<LI> As an element of language, a <b>pattern</b> is an instruction, which shows how this spatial configuration can be used, over and 
over again, to resolve the given system of forces, wherever the context makes it relevant. [Gabriel] <br><br>
<LI> The <b>pattern</b> is, in short, at the same time a thing, which happens in the world, and the rule which tells us how to create 
that thing, and 
when we must create it. It is both a process and a thing; both a description of a thing which is alive, and a description of the process which 
will generate that thing [Gabriel] <br><br> </font>
