<h1>Statement of Work: Group 1</h1>
We are going to use the Kinect to emulate the shadow of the Hero and Snakeman
during their first battle using full body tracking.  The shadow for the 
Hero will look like a normal human, while the Snakeman's shadow will look 
snake-like.  We are going to also work on the possibility of using 2 (or 
more) Kinects at the same time to extend the lateral range of the sensor and 
allow the actors more flexibility in their movements across the stage.
