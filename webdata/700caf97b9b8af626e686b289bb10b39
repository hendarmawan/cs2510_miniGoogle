* <b>OPEN SOURCE:</b> wxWindows is free and open source. <br><br>
* <b>CROSS PLATFORM ABILITY:</b> wxWindows allows you to target Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT/2K/XP, Linux/Unix with the GTK+ toolkit (or plain X11, or Motif), and MacOS. <br><br>

* <b> DOCUMENTATION AND SAMPLES:</b> wxWindows has a reference manual running to around 1800 pages, in a format to suit everyone: HTML, Windows Help, and Acrobat PDF. The user can also get better acquainted with the API by looking at the selection of over 50 samples.
