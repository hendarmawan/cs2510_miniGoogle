<h3 class="title">Some Exam 2 Announcements</h3>
<ul>
<li> You are allowed one sheet of notes as well as a simple calculator, just like Exam 1.
<li> The exam focuses on the materials we've covered after the midterm, but you should also expect some questions covering earlier materials.
<li> Topics may include:
<ul>
<li> Semantic representation (especially first order logic)
<li> Compositional semantics (similar to questions in homework 4)
<li> Lexical semantics (WSD, semantic role labeling, word similarity metrics)
<li> Computational discourse (pronomial coreference resolution, textual coherence)
</ul>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="date">Apr 9, 2015</h2>
<div class="blogbody">
<h3 class="title">Lecture 23</h3>
<p> This lecture introduces computational discourse. In particular, we focused on anaphora resolution. Here are some brief <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/cs2731/04.09.pdf">notes</a> from class. This lecture corresponds to Chapter 21 of J&M.
</div>

<h2 class="date">Apr 7, 2015</h2>
<div class="blogbody">
<h3 class="title">Lecture 22</h3>
<p> In this lecture, we further discussed three relevant tasks in lexical semantics: semantic role labeling, word sense disambiguation, and word similarities. Here are some brief <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/cs2731/04.07.pdf">notes</a> from the lecture. This lecture corresponds to Chapter 20 of J&M.

<h2 class="date">Apr 2, 2015</h2>
<div class="blogbody">
<h3 class="title">Lecture 21</h3>
<p> In this lecture, we introduced issues concerning lexical
semantics. This corresponds to Chapter 19 of J&M. Here are some brief
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/cs2731/04.02.pdf">notes</a>
from the lecture.

<h2 class="date">Mar 31, 2015</h2>
<div class="blogbody">
<h3 class="title">Lecture 20</h3>
<p> In this lecture, we traced through several compositional semantics
examples during class. This corresponds to the first half of Chapter
18 from J&M. We also touched on an alternative approach to
syntax-driven semantics, using Combinatory Categorial Grammars
(CCGs). You may be interested in the <a
href="http://yoavartzi.com/tutorial/">tutorial</a> given by Yoav
Artzi at ACL 2013 (I primarily focused on his section 3.2.1, but you
might find the learning part interesting as well).

<h3 class="title">Homework 4</h3>
<p> This assignment is due by 4/7, 11:59pm. It consists of five exercises from the texbook. Here are the <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/cs2731/hw4.pdf">details</a>.

<b>Edit 4/3:</b> <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/cs2731/hw4photo.pdf">Here</a> is a version of the assignment with the problem inlined for people who don't have a copy of the book ready. Thanks to Yun Huang for compiling the assignment questions.

<h3 class="title">Project Progress Report</h3> 
<p> <b>Due by 11:59pm, 03/31/2015</b>. Each team should submit a brief
  (I expect you'll need ~2 pages, longer is fine too) progress report
  for your term project. You should cover:
<ul>
<li> A precise problem statement. You may also give some
  background/context/motivation for your problem.
<li> Some initial data analysis
<li> A description of your planned methods/approaches. This doesn't
  have to be in a lot of detail yet, but it's better if you start
  thinking about it earlier. 
<li> A list of resources you plan to use. Note: you should contact me
  as soon as possible if there are some data/software resources that
  you think you definitely need but don't have access for. 
<li> A schedule/list of milestones. If you are in a team of three, it
  is especially important for you to figure out a division of labor.
<li> An annotated bibliography of related work (That is, give the
not only the citation but also a couple of sentences saying why it's
  related/useful for your project.)
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Lecture 17</h3>
<p> This lecture starts our discussion on semantics. Here are some

<p> This is an optional activity. You may submit a revised set of
  answers for the
  following <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/cs2731/redoe1.pdf">questions</a>
  for the opportunity to obtain <i>half</i> of the points you've lost on those questions during
  the midterm. We must receive your answers by 11:59pm 3/22. You
  should submit your answers in a PDF file using the submission form.

<h3 class="title">Lecture 9</h3>
<p> Today we began talking about tagging problems in NLP. Specifically, we discussed parts-of-speech tagging. We considered a few learning and non-learning approaches for this task. Next, we will look into a specific kind of probabilistic model of the tagging problem in detail (Hidden Markov Model). Here are some <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/cs2731/02.03.pdf">notes</a> corresponding to today's discussions. Please also read Chapter 5 of J&M.

  <h3 class="title">Lecture 6</h3>
  <p> We continued our discussion on n-gram language models. We framed the problem of developing an n-gram model as a machine learning problem. We talked about how to train the model (with maximum likelihood estimate) and how to evaluate it (using the perplexity/entropy metric for intrinsic evaluation, using LM in an application for an extrinsic evaluation).

  <p> Here are some brief <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/cs2731/01.22.pdf">notes</a> to highlight our discussion points in class.

    <h3 class="title">Lecture 5</h3>
    <p> We finished up our discussions on using finite state transducers to perform some simple morphological analysis. We've also introduced weighted finite state machines. We talked about how to apply WFSM for the purpose of performing probabilistic language modeling. Here are some <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/cs2731/01.20.pdf">notes</a> from the lecture. This corresponds to Chapter 4 of the textbook.

    <p> People have asked for some FST exercises. Here are some for you to try (Adapted from Anoop Sarkar's notes):
      <ul> 
	<li> rot13 encryption (map each of the 26 alphabet letters to one that is 13 letters ahead of it (mod 26). So "cipher" is rewritten as "pvcure" etc.
	<li> add one in binary: input = Binary(n); output = Binary(n+1)
	<li> Translate from English to "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">Pig Latin</a>." For example, "Pig Latin is goofy" becomes "Igpay Atinlay isway oofygay."
