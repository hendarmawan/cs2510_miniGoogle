<b><font size=+1>Managerial Goals for Component-Based Software Engineering</font></b></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>Cost Reduction:</font></li>

<br><font size=+1>One important goal of any development process is to be
cost-effective in developing the software system.</font></ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>Ease of Assembly:</font></li>

<br><font size=+1>Components need to be designed in a manner that facilitates
the subsequent assembly process when components are assembled together
to develop software systems.</font></ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>Reusability:</font></li>

<br><font size=+1>component's potential for reuse in multiple applications.
In component-based software engineering, reusability is the extent to which
a component is (re)used during the assembly process in developing software
systems.</font></ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>Customization and Flexibility:</font></li>

<br><font size=+1>In component-based software engineering , when a set
of components are made available to the application developers, they customize
their systems by assembling components according to their specific requirements.</font></ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>Maintainability:</font></li>

<br><font size=+1>The ease with which software features can be added, removed,
or modified in a component; according to new and emerging requirements.</font></ul>
</ol>
