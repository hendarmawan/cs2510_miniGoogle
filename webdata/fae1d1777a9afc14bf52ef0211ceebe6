As Dr. Chang and I have the different grade file, you may could not receive the update grade vector for the quiz/exercise. As the final exams has been graded, Dr. Chang would send you final update one. You could double check it at that time.

BTW, I will proctor the final this Thursday. Please bring all the late excercises by that class, if you still want to submit. That is final deadline, no submission is allowed after that. If the Question3 on Quiz2 was overcharged to you, you should bring that with you that day.

Good Luck to your finals.

example:
insert into temp_table (date_field) values
(to_date('11/2/90','MM-DD-YY'));
For the select part you have to use TO_CHAR function.
example:
select to_char(date_field,'MM-DD-YY') from some_table;
If date in the cell is 12-Sep-2002 it wil be displayed as 9-12-02. <br><hr><p>

The book says to use the YYYY/MM/DD format.  That is completely wrong for Oracle.  Oracle's default (which I don't know how to change is) DD/MMM/YY . Notice the 3 Ms.  The month is entered as 3 characters not a number.  i.e. June is Jun, January is Jan etc.

For example April 5th 1983 would be:

05/Apr/83

I figured it must be one of the custome elements, so I began a new installation on another (similar) machine to see if Navigator would be useful.  Only problem is I can't find Naviator anywhere in the installation options!  Anyone else had luck?
From what was explain in class about Navigator, I don't think it's the least bit necessary to do our projects; it just seems strange that so many people aren't getting it to install. <br><hr><p>

Lidiya - Your webpage is forbidden, so noone can read the help you put there.  I am curious though, I have most of Oracle installed, and nowhere, even in the Custom install do I see Navigator.  Is it under the personal edition part? can you tell me exactly where it appears in the directory tree?

Also.... I'm still stuck on this DATE business, all docs I've read within oracel, and all over the web, and the book, show DATEs in YYYY-MM-DD format, but i won't work for me in SQL+???<br><hr><p>

* You have to go through "Custom" installation and select to install the Navigator.  It does not come with "Typical" installation.

*To set up the listener & get started with Oracle, use the directions on this website.  If your installation went well, everything should work well.

* I have a similar problem with the requesting of the password(without a user name).  Here is a post that I found that explains the problem. In my case I am completely missing the crucial initSID.ora file.

Some of you may have some trouble with the second assignment.  The due

After the due date, please submit the assignment directly
to Mr. Huang.  His mailbox is in the mail room on the
fifth floor.  Leave the assignment in his mail box.
For this assignment, there will be only one point penalty
if you can submit it by next Thursday, Sept. 26.  After
next Thursday, late submissions will not be accepted.

If you have any problems, please go to see the TA during
his office hours.  When you first install and experiment
with a new system it is always frustrating.  But you will
overcome the difficulties after a while and enjoy the
satisfaction of success.

Here is a message from the TA.....
<p>
Hi,

As some of you may have trouble installing navigator with Oracle 8i or
9, please forget about it temporarily. You are asked to use "SQL*PlUS" to
do the homework. We learned "navigator" just for the class and would not
use it right now. As you launch the "SQL*PLUS", you could input user as
"scott", password as "tiger". Then run the already edited sql file with
command "start ~path/filename.sql". Please read it the headout carefully
and read the first half part of Chapter 8 before you really start to write
the sql script.

Hints on Excercise 2 for CS1550(Fall/02)


##############################################################

-- Create Table

CREATE TABLE STUDENT (--Need to Modify--);

-- Insert Table

INSERT INTO STUDENT () VALUES (--Need to Modify--);

DROP TABLE STUDENT;

##############################################################

Note:

Don't use Navigator do this excercise, but use some editor such as NOTEPAD to edit all of the stuff in one file with extension ".sql".
When using NOTEPAD to edit .sql file, make sure its extension is .sql NOT .txt (in Save as type, choose All Files).

The above schema is strong recommanded to follow, especially " DROP TABLE STUDENT; " is required.

When I grade, I just need to input command: " start A:/yourfile.sql " in SQL Plus to get the correct result;

DATE input format could use "10-NOV-90" and Date Field(colum) name should be something like "COMPLETE_DATA" not "DATE", which is a keyword.

Follow the steps:
1 - Copy the content of your Oracle CD into hard disk in your

2 - Search the file Symcjit.dll on the D drive (where you have 
copied Oracle8i. You can found it in: 

- For Oracle8i 1.7: 

D:\Oracle\stage\Components\oracle.swd.jre\1.1.7.30\1 
\DataFiles\Expanded\jre\win32\bin\symcjit.dll 

- For Oracle8i 1.6: 

D:\Oracle\stage\Components\oracle.swd.jre\1.1.7.24\1 
\DataFiles\Expanded\jre\win32\bin\symcjit.dll 


3 - Rename this file (Example): symcjit_back.dll

Hi
Part (e) of the assignment says that "A grade report has student...."
I think this implies that grade report is an entity and student is an attribute. But then in part (a) we have student as an attribute. 
Is it possible to have an attribute to an entity be an entity or am I mistaken in part (a) the entity is university not student?
