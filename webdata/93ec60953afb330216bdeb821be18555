<br><img src="voteA.jpg"><br>Phone to Phone voting system requirements:<br>
<ol>
<li>
Voter can send short text message from his/her smart
phone to a specific smart phone running voting softwareA (Android version).
<li>
Upon receipt of the short text message containing the ID
number of the best poster (only one should be selected), the said ID number will be entered
in a TallyTable with attributes CandidateID, count.
<li>
The phone number of the voter will be remembered in a
VoterTable with attributes VoterPhoneNo, CandidateID, so that no voter can use the same phone
to vote twice.
<li>
The administrator at the smart phone running voting
softwareA can issue a special command, which will
terminate the voting.  The voting softwareA will
display the TallyTable in decreasing number of votes
so that the first winner will be displayed first and
so on.  At the end the VoterTable will be eliminated.
