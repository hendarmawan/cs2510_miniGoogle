<h3>Lecture 2. Spatial Relations and Patterns (ªÅ¶¡Ãö«Y¤Î¼Ò¦¡)</h3>

<b>
First we talk about the concept of space and the decomposition of space
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/art99/art1016">
(ªÅ¶¡ªº¥@¬É)
</a>.


<p>
Then we talk about Christopher Alexander's <a href="pattern1.htm">pattern language</a> for the architecture of the
built world, and its relation to software engineering  through James O. Coplien's paper <a href="coplien.htm">
"Space: the Final Frontier"</a>. 

<p>
On the computer science side, there is an introduction on 
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/365/elements.html">
visual languages</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/365/chap4.htm">
theoretical work on spatial relations</a>.

a few architectural examples. (Hint: Take the refuge-and-prospect examples from Part I and study the spatial relations and decomposition rules).</h3>

(Wright is to American architecture as Gershwin is to American music, or Whitman to American poetry)
