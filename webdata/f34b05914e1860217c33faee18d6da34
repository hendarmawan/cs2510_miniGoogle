[Audio Chris Bryant to sk chang in private]
 Dr.  Chang:  When  this  VC  session   
 is  over,  may  I  come  by  your  office   
 to  talk  to  you  regarding  a  possible   
 project  over  the  summer  (I  work   
 about  a  5  minute  walk  away)?
[sk chang to Chris Bryant in private]
 Sure,  please  do
[Audio Chris Bryant to sk chang in private]
 I'll  plan  on  it,  then.    See  you  about   
 5-10  minutes  after  the  VC  session   
ends!
[suresh rangan]
 Good  evening  Dr  Chang
[suresh rangan]
 Am  sorry,  i  was  caught  up  a  bit   
 late  in  the  USERS  meeting
[suresh rangan]
 Hello  Everyone
[suresh rangan]
 do  you  all  see  my  messages
[jim clause]
no
[jim clause]
:)
[suresh rangan to sk chang in private]
 Dr  Chang.  Did  i  miss  a  lot  in  the   
class
[suresh rangan]
 Hi  Jim
[Rupa Natarajan]
nothing seems to be going on today in the vc
[suresh rangan]
 I  see  no  activity  in  the  class  and   
 thats  why  i  was  asking
[Rupa Natarajan]
hello all
[Brian Smyth]
We have James Bond with us today.
[suresh rangan]
 Hi  Rupa.   
 Nice  Meeting  you  all  for  the  first   
 time  in  VC
[Rupa Natarajan]
Hi suresh
[anjana divakar]
 hi  everyone
[Rupa Natarajan]
they are going on OK
[suresh rangan]
 Hi  Anjana
[sk chang to Chris Bryant in private]
 SOrry  to  keep  all  of  ytou  waiting
[sk chang to Chris Bryant in private]
 I  was  talking  too  long  with  the  last   
student.
[Audio Chris Bryant to sk chang in private]
 Dr.  chang  -  you're  talking  to  me   
 privately,  not  to  everyone...
[suresh rangan]
 Did  anyone  of  you  tried  to  setup   
 the  VirtualClassroom   
 Development  Environment:
[jim clause]
no, I don;t
[sk chang]
 Sorry  to  keep  all  of  you  waiting,  I   
 was  talking  to  Marius  Giugi  too   
long.
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
Good Evening Professor. Chang.
[sk chang]
 I  sent  e-mail  to  all  of  you  this   
 morning  regarding  exercise  4.
[suresh rangan]
 Hello  Dr  Chang
[sk chang]
 The  deadline  is  extended  to  next   
 Thursday,  after  your  midterm.
[suresh rangan]
 thanks  Dr  Chang
[sk chang]
 ALso,  you  have  a  choice.  You  can   
 use  the  newly  developed  CBSE   
 environment,  if  you  like.
[Chris Bryant]
 ...what  are  we  supposed  to   
 implement  for  Exercise  4?    The   
 ICs  in  Exercise  2/3?
[sk chang]
 Of  course,  to  use  a  newly   
 developed  environment  there  is   
 always  a  lot  of  frustration.    That  is   
 why  2  bonus  points  will  be   
 awarded  to  people  who  opt  to  go   
 that  route.
[sk chang]
 Chris,  you  are  right.    You  are   
 actually  implementing  the  ICs  in   
 exercise  2,  either  using  MICE,  or   
 the  new  enviroment,  or  your  own   
way.
[sk chang]
 You  willl  give  a  demo  to  TA  when   
done.
[suresh rangan]
 Ok.  Dr  Chang,  the  individual   
 implementation  is  totally  on  our   
 hands  isnt  it.
[sk chang]
 Suresh,  that  is  correct.
[suresh rangan]
 How  do  i  get  the  Demo  to  you  Dr   
Chang
[jim clause]
it's in the assignment sheet / emails
[sk chang]
 Well  you  can  use  VC  to  demo  it  to   
 the  TA,  but  you  must  orchestrate  it   
 carefully,  to  push  the  right  pages.
[suresh rangan]
 I  havent  done  that  before.  Wil  ltry   
 to  figure  that  out.
[suresh rangan]
 Dr  chang,  i  was  having  trouble   
 getting  into  the  CVS
[sk chang]
 Also,  by  now  everyone  has   
 selected  a  topic.    So  tonight  I   
 hope  to  send  e-mail  to  subgroups   
 (I  already  did  with  people  working   
 on  message  server)  to  get  things   
rolling.
[suresh rangan]
 that  was  more  specific  to  my   
 userid  s6
[sk chang]
 Suresh,  please  talk  to  John   
 Menke.    I  believe  he  needs  to   
 create  more  user  id/passwords.
[suresh rangan]
 Ok  Dr  Chang
[suresh rangan]
 The  groups,  is  that  in  the  email   
 you  sent  to  me  Dr  Chang
[sk chang]
 We  will  resume  live  class  this   
 THursday.    This  Thursday  I  will   
 also  run  through  all  topics  to  be   
 covered  in  midterm,  and  the   
emphasis.
[sk chang]
 Suresh,  yes.
[suresh rangan]
 Will  i  be  getting  that  in  Email  Dr   
Chang
[sk chang]
 Yes,  there  will  be  a  webpage  for   
 you  to  visit.
[suresh rangan]
 Thanks  Dr  Chang.  I  also  have  one   
 question  with  VC  Setup?
[christopher santamaria]
Sorry I am late
[christopher santamaria]
Why are you crying?
[sk chang]
 Ed  Pavlak,  and  Chris  Garman,   
 notice  I  have  assigned  seminar   
 topics  to  you,  and  you  will  be   
 presenting  immediately  after  the   
 Spring  Break.    Okay?
[Ed Pavlak]
that's fine with me
[marius giurgi]
hi thereË
[Christopher Garman]
 we  present  for  an  entire  class   
 period,  correct?
[sk chang]
 Chris,  half  a  class  period  or  about   
 35  minutes.
[Christopher Garman]
 ok  good
[sk chang]
 Chris,  but  if  you  need  more  time,   
 let  me  know.
[sk chang]
 Suresh,  for  detailed  questions,   
 talk  to  John  Menke  (by  e-mail).
[anjana divakar]
 Dr.Chang  will  u  let  us  know  on   
 what  days  we  have  to  give  the   
seminar?
[Christopher Garman]
 i  think  i  can  stick  within  those   
bounds
[sk chang]
 Good.    ANy  one  has  other   
questions?
[suresh rangan]
 Ok  Dr  Chang.  I  will  get  the   
 information  from  him  on   
endorsed.zip
[sk chang]
 Suresh,  if  you  succeed  in  running   
 the  example  provided  by  John,  let   
 me  know  immediately.
[suresh rangan]
 I  was  able  to  successfully  install   
 Eclipse,  MyEclipse,  Tomcat..
[suresh rangan]
 Just  that  i  am  stuck  with  knowing   
 where  the   
 jmenke/home/endorsed.zip  is
[sk chang]
 Good  for  you.
[sk chang]
 The  tutorial,  John  sent  it  to  me  at   
 3am  last  night.    So  it  must  be   
imperfect.
[sk chang]
 Any  other  questions?
[suresh rangan]
 Ok  Dr  Chang.  I  will  send  an  email.  I   
 sent  one  couple  of  days  back  and   
 i  havent  got  a  reply.
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
Sounds good to me.
[Ganesh Santhanakrishnan]
I have no other questions.
[Beatriz Maeireizo]
 I    don't    have    further    questions,    Dr.    Chang.    Thank     
you.
[Brian Smyth]
If you get a reply, Suresh, maybe you can forward it to the rest of the class as well.
[suresh rangan]
 I  am  looking  good  Dr  Chang.  Will   
 get  back  with  you/TA  if  i  have  any   
 questions  later
[Chris Bryant]
 Thanks,  Dr.  Chang.
[Rupa Natarajan]
