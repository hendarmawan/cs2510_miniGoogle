The code was originally included in v0.3 of the integration.  v0.3.2 contains updated code.

Before running program, please download ml.oni and mr.oni from the following addresses:

http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~huyang/kinect/ml.oni
http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~huyang/kinect/mr.oni

Place both files in the /Developer/Kinect/ directory (if the Kinect directory does not exist, create it).

To run demo, run the command ./runit.sh --group 1 from the v0.3.2 directory.  The program should still work from the v0.3 directory as well.
