			<h3>Types of User Objectives:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Target Search <br>
				</b>- There is a specific image in the database that the user is 
				looking for (e.g. Mona Lisa).<br>
				- User may be looking for an same image that was taken at 
				different angle.</li>
				<li><b>Category search</b> <br>
				- The user is mostly interested in retrieving images of the same 
				(semantic) category (e.g. renaissance paintings).</li>
				<li><b>Search by association</b> <br>
				- The user is not looking for a particular image or a series, 
				s/he is looking for “ideas”.<br>
				- Users of <i>search by association</i> at the start have no 
				specific aim other than find interesting things.<br>
				- Often implies iterative refinement of the search, the 
				similarity or the examples with which the search was started.<br>
				- Systems are typically highly interactive where the feedback 
				from the user can shape the next query.</li>
