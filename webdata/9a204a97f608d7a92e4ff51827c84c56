<H1>Terminological Reasoning with Plans and an Application to Plan Recognition</H1>
<p>
Terminological knowledge representation systems based on KL-ONE are
widely used in artificial intelligence to represent and reason with taxonomies of concept
descriptions.  A major limitation of terminological approaches,
however, is an inability to represent and reason with plans. Plans,
complex compositions of actions that achieve given goals, play a
central role in many areas that have provided applications for
terminological representation systems. 
<p>
This research concerns the development of knowledge representation
and reasoning systems that extend the notions
of terminological systems to plans.  CLASP provides a knowledge
representation language to describe plans by integrating work in
automata theory with work in knowledge representation.  CLASP was
motivated by the needs of a knowledge-based information retrieval
system in the domain of telephone switching software (e.g., plans
represent telephone features such as call forwarding).  In T-REX,
plans are represented as networks of actions related by a rich variety
of constraints: qualitative temporal constraints, metric temporal
constraints, and equality constraints.  T-REX also introduces a new
view of plan recognition as a process which dynamically partitions a
plan library by modalities, e.g., necessary, possible and impossible,
while actions are being observed.
