<h3>Proposal Guidelines</h3>

<p>The proposal for this project is very important, as it provides me
with an understanding of what you hope to accomplish, and how you plan
to accomplish it.  To this end, the proposal should have the following
structure:</p>

<ul>

  <li> <b>Section 1: Introduction.</b>  The introduction section of
  your proposal should provide sufficient background to motivate your
  work.  Furthermore, it should define the <i>type</i> of project that
  you plan to carry out.  For instance, do you plan to write a survey
  paper that systematizes knowlege of a particular area of
  security/privacy research?  Do you plan to pose a research question
  that can be addressed by a combination of literature study and
  proof-of-concept prototyping?  Use this section to
  explain <i>why</i> your proposed plan is important and <i>what</i>
  you hope to learn by conducting this project.  After reading your
  introduction, I should have a clear idea of what problem you are
  addressing, and what the intellectual merit of your proposed
  research is.</li><br>

  <li> <b>Section 2: Research Plan.</b> This section should define at
  a more technical level the tasks that need to be done as part of
  your project. Each task should be numbered and described in
  detail.</li><br>

  <li> <b>Section 3: Proposed Timeline.</b>  This section of your
  proposal should describe the time required to conduct each of the
  tasks outlined in Section 2.  Furthermore, approximate completion
  dates should be listed for each deliverable identified in Section
  3.</li>

</ul>

<p>In total, I expect that your proposal will be approximately 3-5 pages
in length.  However, this is just a guideline, and you will not be
penalized for writing a more detailed proposal.  Overall clarity of
presentation is much more important than page limits!</p>
