	  href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Eciddeweb/FACULTY-DEVELOPMENT/TA_HANDBOOK/end-draft.htm">http://www.pitt.edu/~ciddeweb/FACULTY-DEVELOPMENT/TA_HANDBOOK/end-draft.htm</a> for definition and examples.  <b>Plagiarizers will fail this course and receive disciplinary actions according to university policies</b>.</p> -->
<p>All submitted work <b>must be your own work</b>.
<b>Plagiarizers will fail this course and receive
disciplinary actions according to university policies</b>.<br>
</p>
<h3 class="title">Absences</h3>
<p>If an absence is unavoidable, you are responsible for making
arrangements <b>to ensure that your assignments are turned in on time</b>.
You are also responsible for obtaining the materials passed out and the
information announced during the missed class. In case of extraordinary
circumstances (hospitalization, family emergency) you should contact me
as soon as possible so that we may arrange an extension for an
assignment or schedule a make-up exam <i>prior to the due date</i>.
Late assignments <b>will not</b> be accepted. No make-ups will be
given for pop-quizzes</p>
<h3 class="title">Course Grade</h3>
<p>The course grade will be decided based on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Class participation (70%) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Reaction commentaries (40%)</li>
    <li>Discussion leads (30%) </li>
  </ul> 
  <li> Term Project (30%) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Drafts and reviews (10%)</li>
    <li>Final presentations (5%)</li>
    <li>Final project report (15%)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Class Participations</h3>
<p> A large portion of this course is devoted to
discussing research papers. You will take turns to present the
papers (probably three times in a semester, depending on the size of the
class). To help the presenter to direct class discussions
better, everyone is expected to write a short reaction essay for the
assigned papers.&nbsp; <b>Do not just summarize the paper</b>. The
commentary should focus on your critique of the papers.&nbsp; You may
find this <a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/%7Ehwa/ramsey00.ps">guideline
for reading research paper</a> helpful.&nbsp; Your reactions should be
concise (200-300 words).</p>

<h3 class="title">Office Hours</h3>
<p>Please make appointments at least a day in advance.</p>

<h3 class="title">Class Conduct</h3>
<p>Professional behavior is expected from everyone. Please mute your
cell phone during class.&nbsp; Phone rings are disruptive to
lectures because they interrupt everyone's train of thought.
</p>
<h3 class="title">Students With Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and
Disability Resources and Services, 216 William Pitt Union, (412)
648-7890/(412) 383-7355 (TTY), as early as possible in the term. DRS
will verify your disability and determine reasonable accomodations for
this course. </p>
