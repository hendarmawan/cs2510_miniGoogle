<h1>Slow Intelligence Operators</h1>
</center>
<h2>
The following two elementary slow intelligence operators are defined for problem sets.

<p>
(1)	Enumerator: P1 <font color=red>-enum< </font> P2  is the enumerator that takes each problem element of P1 to generate a number of new elements, which are put into P2.  Therefore the cardinality of P2 is usually larger than that of P1.

<p>
(2)	Eliminator: P1 <font color=red> >elim- </font> P2  is the eliminator that eliminates non-solution elements of P1 and put the rest into P2.  Therefore the cardinality of P2 is usually smaller than that of P1.
