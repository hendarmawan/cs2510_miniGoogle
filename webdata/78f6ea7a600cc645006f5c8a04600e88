Information of extra responsiblities
------------------------------------

Our group's main extra responsibilities included preparing the integration class diagram for the entire class.
Since, this project included many components including everything into one single diagram didnot seem 
as a reasonable choice. Based on our professor's suggestion, we created a lower level and higher level class
diagram for the entire class. This could give a better understanding of the various components used by different groups 
and their relationship to one another. 

Lower level class diagram included components that are fundamental to many of the other components in the
the project. These are also the key components would most likely be used in the future to build new components.

Higher level class diagram included components that are greatly using the lower level components. The higher level components could also be used by other components. 

We used the existing individual class diagrams of each of the groups to form a cohensive and compatible class diagrams for the entire class. This process included many modifications, additions based on mutual consultation of the various groups. We also made new changes to integrated class diagrams based on any changes that each of the groups made to their individual class diagrams. This process included communicating with various groups as well as monitoring the changes of individual groups. So, we arrived at the current integrated classes as an iterative process.
