<b>Delete Cookies</b></li>

<br><b>Netscape saves its cookie data in a file called cookies.txt.&nbsp;
Microsoft Internet Explorer no longer has a single cookies.txt file.&nbsp;
It has a folder in the windows directory with lots of individual txt files
inside.&nbsp; You can</b>
<br><b>go to the file/directory and remove the cookie entries/files that
are from servers you don't like.&nbsp; However, to do this properly, remember
to close your browser first.&nbsp; This is because all your cookies are
held in memory until you close your browser.&nbsp; So if you delete the
file with your browser open, it will make a new file when you close it
and your cookies will be back.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Screen Cookies</b></li>

<br><b>Both Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer allow some level of
cookie verification.&nbsp; Netscape 3.0 and MSIE 3.0 allow you only to
"alert before accepting cookies".&nbsp; This is done through the <font color="#990000">Options/Network
Preference/Protocols menu</font> ( for Netscape ) or the I<font color="#990000">nternet
Options/Advanced menu</font> ( for MSIE ).&nbsp; This means you can read
each cookie as it comes in, and hit "OK" to allow it, or "Cancel" to reject
it.&nbsp; Netscape 4.0 and MSIE 4.0 go one better.&nbsp; They have menu
options that allow you to accept all, some, or none of your incoming cookies.&nbsp;
In addition, the "warn before accepting" feature is still present in both,
if you want to sceen your incoming cookies.&nbsp; In Netscape 4.0, go to
the <font color="#990000">Edit/Preferences/Advanced </font>menu.&nbsp;
You will see all of the above choices.&nbsp; In MSIE 4.0, go to the <font color="#990000">View/Internet
Options/Advanced</font> menu.&nbsp; There you can accept all, warn before
accepting, or reject all.</b>
