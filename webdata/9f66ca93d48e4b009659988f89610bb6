<u><h2 align=center>General Directions for Personal Oracle 8</h2></u>
<pre>	To get started once Personal Oracle 8 (PO8) has been installed,
go to where ever you have placed the program and open the Oracle 8 Navigator.
This will take you to the files associated with PO8.<br>
	Next you will want to create a new user profile, unless you want
to simply use one of the profiles provided.  I would suggest creating a 
new profile to help familiarize you with the system  (see <a href="newuser.htm">New Users</a>).<br>

	After creating your profile you will want to create a project 
for whatever you are working on (see <a href="projects.html">New Projects</a>).<br>

	Once the project has been created you can fill that project 
with tables and views.  Tables are the objects used in PO8 to store 
the information of your database (see <a href="tables.html">New Tables</a>).<br>  When creating 
tables there are several differing values types that can be assigned.<br>
	Here is an explanation of those values:
</pre>
<dl>
<dt>"<b><i>Char</b></i><dd> Alphanumeric data at least 1 character long and no more than 255 characters. Use this for fields that have a combination of characters and numbers, such as addresses.

<dt><b><i>Date</b></i><dd> Oracle includes as part of the date the century, year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.

<dt><b><i>Long</b></i><dd> Variable length alphanumeric strings up to 2 gigabytes in size.

<dt><b><i>Long Raw</b></i><dd> Binary data up to 2 gigabytes in size.

<dt><b><i>Number</b></i><dd> Stores numeric zero, positive, or negative fixed or floating point data. Use this for fields that will only contain numbers.

<dt><b><i>Raw</b></i><dd> Binary data up to 255 bytes in size.

<dt><b><i>RowID</b></i><dd> Hexadecimal string representing the unique address of a row in a table.

<dt><b><i>Varchar2</b></i><dd> Alphanumeric data at least 1 character long and no more than 2,000 characters long. This is the same as the CHAR field except it accommodates more text input. You can use this field for entering memos or paragraphs."

<pre>
	Once Tables have been defined a view can then be defined off of a table.
A view is the object that PO8 uses to display a query.  This query is 
usually some form of an SQL statement (see <a href="views.html">New Views</a>).
