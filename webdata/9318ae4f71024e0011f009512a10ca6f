<h2>SOAP is platform independant</h2>

<p><font size="4">The example SOAP data packet demonstrates an
important feature: SOAP is platform independant. There are no
proprietary formattings or other data being hidden. The data
request packet is XML and the form it is being presented in is an
HTTP POST command. There is no way to infer whether the caller or
receiver is Windows, Linux, Mac, or other OS. Nor can it be
inferred what kind of objects are involved - whether they are COM/DCOM,
Corba, RMI, or something else entirely.</font></p>

<h2>SOAP can replace binary RPC</h2>

<p><font size="4">Soap is <em>not</em> a distributed object
protocol - it operates on a lower level. SOAP is a network &quot;wire&quot;
protocol.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">What does this mean? It means that SOAP can be
used as the RPC wire protocol for existing RPC and distributed
object protocols - whether that be DCE's RPC, DCOM, Corba or
Java's RMI. From the object user's perspective, SOAP can
transparently replace the wire protocol for all of these.</font></p>

<h2>SOAP is built on open standards</h2>

<p><font size="4">SOAP does not involve any proprietary standards.
It is built on a foundation of two open protocols, XML and HTTP.
It itself is an open standard, one that is gaining wide industry
support. Its proponents include both Microsoft and Sun(!) </font></p>

<h2>SOAP is secure</h2>

<p><font size="4">SOAP solves the difficult network security
problems presented by proprietary technologies. And it does so
again with open standards. SOAP may use either HTTPS or SSL. This
is felt to be adequate in addressing almost all general
transmission security needs.</font></p>
