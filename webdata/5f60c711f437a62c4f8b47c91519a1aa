		<h1>Invoking a Search and Displaying Results</h1>
		<hr>
	</center>
	<p>
		Two basic types of search result:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Inclusion or exclusion</strong>: includes only those documents determined by the system as satisfying the query. The documents won't be in any particular order.</li>
			<li><strong>Relevance-based</strong>: Inclusion or exclusion search results but includes documents with a range of relevance.  Most releveant results are presented first.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		The best sort of result presentation will put the most satisfying
		matches at the top. It should also present matches in a
		way that helps a user refine a search if necessary - perhaps by providing
		context for each result or by providing associated information
		such as modification date or user-entered comments.
