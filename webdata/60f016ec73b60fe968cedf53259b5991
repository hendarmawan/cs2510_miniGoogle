<h2>Assembly versioning</h2>

<p><font size="4">The strides taken by .NET against DLL Hell can
not be underestimated. By providing a means to ensure version
compatibility between shared libraries and even within one's own
upgrades, businesses have more freedom to upgrade their products
and provide them to users for immediate download without having
to spend the same degree of worry regarding dependencies that
they do now.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Will .NET finally shut the gates to DLL Hell
once and for all? Versioning is a complex problem - only time and
experience will answer that. But the moves it has made help, in
addition to its web service concept, to make possible the
following software model: &quot;software as a service&quot;.</font></p>
