   <h1>What is PageRank?</h1>
   <br></br>
<p>PageRank allows Google to quickly scan its index and produce highly
relevant results to a search query, often in less than half a second
<font color="red">*</font></p>
<p>Google looks to see how many links a page has from other pages on the
web</p>
<p>Each page receives a score based on how many links there are to it, as
well as the relevance of each site of which has a link to this page</p>
<p>Important, high-quality sites receive a higher PageRank, which Google
remembers each time it conducts a search
<font color="red">*</font></p>
<p>This technique is fully automated, with no human intervention to
determine the value of a page's importance</p>
