<h2>Kye Issues
<p>
Business Goals:
The technology you use must match the business goals.
Components are the right answer for complex and mission-critical
systems.  They are robust, scalable and flexible.
Component technology often trades simplicity for scalability and flexibility.
The potential payback for components may be too low for a given application.

Component technology can show real benefits if your organization
