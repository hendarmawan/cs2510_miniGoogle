   <h1>Ponder This...?</h1>

<ul>
   <li>What if you wanted to perform an action on your web page in which
       there was no previously defined action written?</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Embed the code into the JSP using Declarations.</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Can lead to long and drawn out JSPs that can become less
             readable.</li>
         <li>Cannot reuse the code for another application.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Write the code in its own JSP, and then use the include Action
          or Directive to call each method.</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Leads to more modular design.</li>
         <li>Scalability and portability issues arise from the use of
             include.</li>
      </ul>
   </ul>
   <li>There is a better way to accomplish this task!</li>
</ul>
