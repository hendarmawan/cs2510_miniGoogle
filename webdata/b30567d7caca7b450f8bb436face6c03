</H2>
Dr. Chang is truly a man of two cultures and a very creative scholar.
He is a distinguished scientist, an educator with vision,
an accomplished novelist and <a href="house/captain1.jpg">captain</a> of his <a href="house/lake08g1.jpg">Chronobot</a>.  His scientific contributions include
the reconstruction of images from projections, the theory of symbolic
projection, and theory of icons for visual languages.  His papers are
widely cited by researchers in image information systems and visual
languages.  He also developed the first picture grammar and the phonetic
phrase Chinese input method, and co-founded the <a h ref="http://jupiter.ksi.edu/~clcs/"> Chinese Language Computer
Society </a>.  His vision in education led him to establish a unique graduate
school of computers and management.  His novels have been translated
into many languages and adopted into textbooks for studying Chinese.
<p>
Dr. Chang received the B.S.E.E. degree from National
Taiwan University in 1965.  He received the M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1967 and
1969, respectively.  He was a research scientist at IBM Watson
Research Center from 1969 to 1975.  From 1975 to 1982 he
was Associate Professor and then Professor at the Department
of Information Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago.
From 1982 to 1986 he was Professor and Chairman
of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute
of Technology.  From 1986 to 1991 he was Professor and Chairman of the
Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh.  He is currently
Professor and Director of the Center for Parallel, Distributed and Intelligent
Systems, University of Pittsburgh.  He was consultant for IBM, AT&T Bell
Laboratories, Standard Oil, Honeywell, Naval Research Laboratory and Siemens.
Dr. Chang is also a Fellow of IEEE.
<p>
Dr. Chang has published over two hundred sixty six
<a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/papers.html"> papers </a> and written and/or edited sixteen books.
Dr. Chang's research on image reconstruction
from projections <a href="papers.html#RECON"> [A3,A7,A13] </a> provided a theoretical foundation for
subsequent research in computerized tomography.
He developed the theory of symbolic projection <a href="papers.html#2D"> [A48,A53] </a> which stimulated
research in image information systems.
He conceived the theory of icons <a href="papers.html"> [A43,A54] </a> to serve as the foundation
for visual languages <a href="papers.html"> [A66,A78,A88,A91] </a>.
He wrote the pioneering advanced textbook on
<i>Principles of Pictorial Information Systems Design</i>
(Prentice-Hall 1989).
His book on <i>Symbolic Projection for Image Information Retrieval and Spatial Reasoning</i> was published by
Academic Press in 1996,
and <i>Multimedia Software Engineering</i>
was published by Kluwer Academic Publishers in 2000.
The most recent book edited by Chang is an impressive, sixteen hundred
pages, two-volume handbook on Software Engineering and
Knowledge Engineering, published by World Scientific in 2002.
He served as distinguished guest lecturer of IEEE Computer Society,
and guest editor of 1981 IEEE <i>Computer</i> Special Issue
on Pictorial Information Systems.
He is the founder and co-editor-in-chief of the international journal,
<a href="ijvlc.html"><i>Visual Languages and Computing</i></a>,
published by Academic Press,
the founder and editor-in-chief of the international journal,
<a href="http://www.ksi.edu/ijsk.html"><i>Software Engineering & Knowledge Engineering</i></a>,
published by World Scientific Press,
and the co-editor-in-chief of the international journal
on <i>Distance Education Technologies</i> published by the Idea Group Publishing.
<p>
Dr. Chang also pioneered the development of Chinese language computers,
and was the first to develop a picture grammar for Chinese ideographs <a href="papers.html"> [A9] </a>,
and invented the phonetic phrase Chinese input method <a href="papers.html"> [A10] </a>.
He organized the First International Symposium on
Computers and Chinese Input/Output Systems.  He was the co-founder
of the Chinese Language Computer Society, and has been
a leader in Chinese language computer research for many years.
<p>
In 1978, Dr. Chang founded <a href="http://www.ksi.edu/"> Knowledge Systems Institute </a>, which
is a graduate school dedicated to advanced education of computer
and information sciences.  The Institute was accredited in 1991
by North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.  It now has
about one hundred graduate students.  Knowledge Systems Institute has
become a model institute of higher learning, realizing
Dr. Chang's vision to revive the tradition of Chinese
<i>Shu-Yuan</i> as an educational paradigm.
In 2002 KSI was rated by U.S. News as one of the engineering schools
offering
<a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/elearning/tables/eng_reg.htm">
accredited online graduate programs</a>  
together with such top schools as Stanford
University, Columbia University, Purdue University, etc.

for advanced study of Chinese
edited by Neal Robbins and published by Yale University Press.
University of Illinois adopted "The Amateur Cameraman" in course materials
for studying Chinese.
