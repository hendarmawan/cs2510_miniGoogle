<b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
Before the UML, there were several modeling languages for software development, which made passing the project to others or corporate takeovers difficult.  The problem was resolved when the UML was developed and became the standard modeling language.<br>
The UML provides a multifaceted blueprint that's comprehensible to clients, programmers, and everyone involved in the development process.  By having many kind of diagrams of the UML, we can meet the needs of different stakeholders.
