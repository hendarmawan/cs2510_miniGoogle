<font size = "5">
While a number of commercial class libraries already existed for cross-platform development, none other than wxWindows met all of the following criteria: <br><br>
1) low price; <br>
2) source availability;<br> 
3) simplicity of programming;<br> 
4) support for a wide range of compilers.<br><br>
As open source software, wxWindows has benefited from comments, ideas, bug fixes, enhancements and the sheer enthusiasm of users. 
This gives wxWindows a certain advantage over its commercial competitors, plus a robustness against the transience of one individual or company.<br><br>
The importance of using a platform-independent class library cannot be overstated, since GUI application development is very time-consuming, and sustained
 popularity of particular GUIs cannot be guaranteed. Code can very quickly become obsolete if it addresses the wrong platform or audience. 
wxWindows helps to insulate the programmer from these winds of change.
