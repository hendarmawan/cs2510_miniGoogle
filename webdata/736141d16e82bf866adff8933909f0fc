<h4>HIPR2 is a web-based set of tutorial materials for the 50 most commonly used 
  image processing operators. It contains tutorial text, sample results and JAVA 
  demonstrations of individual operators and collections. It was created by the 
  Artificial Intelligence Dept. of the University of Edinburgh, in order to help 
  teach image processing and machine vision. 
  <p>Descriptions of operators, JAVA demonstrations of single and combined operators, 
    an image library (also including processed images), student exercises, glossary, 
    bibliography, a comparison to operators in some other packages, and the means 
    to create more worksheets of your own are included in HIPR2!</p>
