<title>Create a Function</title>
</head>
<body>
You want to go to your current project folder.  Then select NEW FUNCTION<br>
from the drop down menu.<br><br>

<image src="createfunction.gif"><br><br>

Enter a Name and a user for the function.<br><br>

<image src="namefunction.gif"><br><br>

Next you want to type in the function.<br>
Here is an example: <a href="exmplfunc.html">NUM_PETS</a><br><br>

<image src="typefunction.gif"><br><br>

To use a function in a view or table you will need to connect to the<br>
database using Plus80w.exe, which can be found in the "ToolBox" folder<br>
in the Projects folder.<br><br>

You will be prompted to Logon to the system.  Just use the User Profile<br>
and Password that you created.  <br><br>

This will log you onto the system.  Next you want to type in your PL/SQL<br>
code for creating a new view that uses your function.<br><br>

I have placed an example of this statement here: 
<a href="exmplplsql.html">PL/SQL</a><br><br>
Once you have correctly entered the CREATE statement it will notify<br>
you with a "View created" and a new prompt.  You can now exit by typing"Exit."<br>
Now go back to Navigator and close the INNER Navigator window.  Reopen<br>
it by going to WINDOW-->Navigator, and this will refresh the Navigator for you.<br><br>

You can now locate the new view in the VIEW folder under the LOCAL DATABASE.<br>

To move it into your Project just Click and Drag it into your Project folder.<br><br>

Now you can access the view as you would any other.<br><br>
