<h3>
<p>
The execution of a Petri-net is controlled by the position and
movement of markers (called
<i>tokens)</i>
in the Petri-net.  Tokens, indicated by black dots, reside
in the circles representing the places of a net.  A Petri-net with tokens is called a
<i>marked Petri-net.</i>
Tokens are moved by the
<i>firing</i>
of the transitions of the net.  A transition must be
<i>enabled</i>
in order to fire.  (A transition is enabled when all of its
input places have a token in them).  The transition fires by
removing the enabling tokens from their input places
and generating new tokens which are deposited in the output places of
the transition.
<p>
As an example, in the marked Petri-net of Figure 2, the transition t2
is enabled since it has a token in its input place (p1).  If t2 fires,
the marked Petri-net of Figure 3 results.  The firing of transition t2 removes
the enabling token from place p1 and puts tokens in p2 and p3, the  two
outputs of t2.
