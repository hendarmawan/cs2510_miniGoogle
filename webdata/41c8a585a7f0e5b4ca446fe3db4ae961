 <center>&nbsp;</center>"Effective modeling of complex 
concurrent systems requires a formalism that can capture essential properties 
such as nondeterminism, synchronization and parallelism. Petri nets offer a 
clean formalism for concurrency, however lack thorough modularization 
techniques. Object orientation offers formalism for highly reusable and modular 
systems, but lacks general concurrency features. There have been a number of 
attempts to combine Petri nets with Object Oriented concepts to profit from the 
strengths of both approaches "
