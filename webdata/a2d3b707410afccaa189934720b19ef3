In their <a href="inbodysensorschallenges.pdf">paper</a>, "Research challenges in wireless networks of biomedical 
sensors", the authors describe the potential of biomedical smart sensors
and discuss challenges for design and deployment of wireless networking 
of human-embedded smart sensors. 

You need to select a specific challenge
and discuss possible approaches to its solution. You are not required
to provide a full solution. You simply need to explore the issues
