(As an alternate exercise for Exercise 4)
<br>
(a) Explore different Petri net realizations
for the super-components.
We can make the execution of the algorithms all
serial, all parallel, probabilistic, and so on.
There are many different sub-types of Petri nets that
can be explored.
You should at least try serial and parallel nets.
There will be bonus if you try other nets such as
probabilistic nets.
<br>
<br>
(b) Develop on paper the algorithm for a transformer to transform
original Petri net specification
(in <a href="http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~chang/231/sisic/C-Card1.xml">pnml</a> format)
into the expanded Petri net specification (in pnml format).
Demonstrate on paper how your algorithm works by going
through the critical steps and illustarting with
an example such as the one described in Exercise 3(c).
<br>
<br>
*(c) (optional bonus part/term project) If you can come up with Java implementation to transform
original Petri net (in pnml format) to expanded
Petri net (also in pnml format) you will get bonus.
Or this option work can be part of your
term project.
<br>
<p>
This topic is for those who are already familiar
with Petri net and those who are interested in
implementation type of projects.
