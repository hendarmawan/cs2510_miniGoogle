Spoken dialogue is a natural and highly desirable form of student-computer interaction, which
provides both opportunities and challenges to both dialogue-based tutoring systems, and to spoken language systems. The goal of this research is to
wed spoken language technology with instructional technology, in order to promote learning gains by enhancing communication richness. For further
details, see the project descriptions and papers below, as well as information on the tutoring back-end (<a href=http://www.pitt.edu/~vanlehn/why2000.html>Why2</a>,
a text-based tutoring system in the domain of qualitative physics).-->

Teaching Writing and Argumentation with AI-Supported Diagramming and Peer Review 
</FONT> 
(<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/swordlrdc/">project homepage</a>) 
(Sep. 2011 - Aug. 2016)</h4>
<p>
The PIs are investigating the design of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that are aimed at learning in unstructured domains. Such systems are not able to do as much automatically as ITSs working in traditionally narrow and well-structured domains, but rather they need to share responsibilities for scaffolding learning with a teacher and/or peers. In the work proposed, the three PIs, who share expertise in automated natural language understanding, intelligent tutoring systems, machine learning, argumentation (especially in law), complex problem solving, and engineering education, are integrating intelligent tutoring, data mining, machine learning, and language processing to design a socio-technical system (people and machines working together) that helps undergraduates and law students write better argumentative essays. The work of helping learners derive an argument is shared by the computer and peers, as is the work of helping peer reviewers review the writing of others and the work of learners to turn their argument diagrams into well-written documents. Research questions address the roles computers might take on in promoting writing and the technology that enables that, how to distribute scaffolding between an intelligent machine and human agents, how to promote better writing (especially the relationship between diagramming and writing), and how to promote learning through peer review of the writing of others.
<p>
This project is bringing together outstanding researchers from a variety of different disciplines -- artificial intelligence, law education, engineering and science education, and cognitive psychology -- to address an education issue of national concern -- writing, especially writing that makes and substantiates a point -- and to explore ways of extending intelligent tutoring systems beyond fact-based domains. It fulfills all aims of the Cyberlearning program -- to imagine, design, and learn how to best design and use the next generation of learning technologies, to address learning issues of national importance, and to contribute to understanding of how people learn.

Intelligent Scaffolding for Peer Reviews of Writing
(<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/swordlrdc/">project homepage</a>) </FONT> 
(Sep. 2012 - Aug. 2015)</h4>
<p>
This study will adapt and apply existing Artificial Intelligence
techniques from Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to
automatically scaffold the peer reviewing and
revising-from-peer-review process. Utilizing an iterative development
plan more complex and refined versions of the system will be used with
heavy testing in October and March each year.  Researchers will
undertake three different but partially integrated interventions:
automatic detection of effective review comment features, automatic
detection of thesis statements and related comments, and facilitating
author revision by organizing review comments and author response
planning.  The pilot experiment will take place in a high school
setting the last 6 months of the grant.
<p>
Iterative development will be conducted in four classroom environments:
      high school science, high school English/social studies, a
      university physics lab, and a university psychology class. The
      comparison group will include students using the same web-based
      peer review system as the treatment group, but with all the
      intelligent scaffolding interventions disabled.

Response-to-Text Prompts to Assess Students' Writing Ability:  Using Natural Language Processing for Scoring Writing at Scale
</FONT>
(July 2013 - June 2015)</h4>
<p>
Assessing analytic writing in response to text (RTA) is a means for
understanding students’ analytic writing
ability and understanding
measures of effective teaching.
Current writing assessments typically examine “content-free” writing (i.e.,
writing in response to open-ended prompts divorced from text), although
prior work demonstrates that it is also possible to administer and rate student
writing in response-to-text.
However, there is a significant barrier to scoring writing at scale,
as scoring is labor intensive and requires extensive
training and expertise on the part of raters to obtain reliable
scores.
<p>
Recent advances in artificial intelligence
offer a promising way forward for scoring students’ analytic writing
at scale. Natural language processing (NLP) experts have been working
for decades on producing ways to reliably score student writing
holistically. 
The state-of-the-art of
automated essay systems (AES) indicates that AES can produce
scores as reliable as human ratings in the sense that they can be
trained to score similarly to humans on holistic measures of writing,
especially for short, timed student responses.
To move the field forward, however, there is a need for writing
assessments that are aligned with authentic writing tasks.
Second, there is a need to explore whether AES algorithms can
reliably score across multiple dimensions of student
writing. Our assessement includes five dimensions (analysis,
evidence, organization, style/vocabulary and
mechanics/usage/grammar/syntax) and it will be important to see if AES
designs can rate substantive dimensions such as analysis and evidence
as well as they can rate more surface and structural dimensions of
writing.

Peer Review Search & Analytics in MOOCs via Natural Language Processing</FONT>
(February 2014)</h4>
<p>
Peer assessments provided by students are widely used in
massively open-access online courses (MOOCs) due to the difficulty of
fully-automating assessment for many types of assignments.  However,
the
use of student assessment provides an overwhelming amount of textual
information for instructors to process.  The proposed research will
develop Natural Language Processing methods to support search and
large

Improving Undergraduate STEM Education by Integrating Natural Language Processing with Mobile Technologies
</FONT>
(July 2014 - June 2016)</h4>
<p>
The degree and quality of interaction between students and instructors
are critical factors for students' engagement, retention, and learning
outcomes across domains.  This is especially true for the introductory
STEM courses at the undergraduate level since these courses are
generally taught in lecture halls due to a large number of students
enrolled.  Recent developments in educational technology such as MOOCs
and financial troubles in universities make it safe to predict that
the class size problem will only get worse both in traditional
face-to-face and online classes.  So, how can we modify the passive
nature of lectures and increase the interaction while actively
involving both students and instructors in the learning process in
these circumstances?
<p>
In order to address this problem, we propose integrating Natural
Language Processing (NLP) with a mobile application that prompts
students to reflect as well as provide immediate and continuous
feedback to instructors about the difficulties that their students
encounter.  By enhancing the student reflection and instructor
feedback cycle with technological tools, this project will
incorporate three lines of research: 1) role of students' reflection
and instructor's feedback on students' retention and learning
outcomes, 2) effectiveness and reliability of NLP to summarize written
responses in a meaningful way, and 3) value and design of mobile
technologies to improve retention and learning in STEM domains.  This

<ul><h4><FONT color=purple>Entrainment and Task Success in Team Conversations</FONT>
(August 2014 - July 2017)</h4>
<p>
Teams, rather than individuals, are now the usual generators of scientific knowledge. How to optimize team interactions is a passionately pursued topic across several disciplines. This research hypothesizes that linguistic entrainment, or the convergence of linguistic properties of spoken conversation, may serve as a valid and relatively easy-to-collect measure that is predictive of team success. From the perspective of developing interventions for team innovation, organizations could unobtrusively measure team effectiveness using entrainment, and intervene with training to aid teams with low entrainment. Similar interventions would be useful for conversational agents that monitor and facilitate group interactions. The work could also support the development of browsers or data mining applications for corpora such as team meetings or classroom discussions.
<p>
To date, most studies of entrainment have focused on conversational dyads rather than the multi-party conversations typical of teams. The technical objective of this research is to develop, validate and evaluate new measures of linguistic entrainment tailored to multi-party conversations. In particular, the first research goal is to develop multi-party entrainment measures that are computable using language technologies, and that are both motivated and validated by the literature on teams. The second goal is to demonstrate the utility of these measures in being associated with team processes and predicting team success. The supporting activities include 1) collection of an experimentally-obtained corpus where teams collaborate on a task where they converse, and where a team process intervention manipulates likely entrainment, 2) development of a set of entrainment measures for multi-party dialogue, 3) use of standard psychological teamwork measures for convergent validity and random conversations for divergent validity, 4) exploration of how the team factors of gender composition and participation equality impact group entrainment, and 5) evaluation of the utility of measuring entrainment for predicting team and dialogue success.

<ul><h4><FONT color=purple> An Intelligent Ecosystem for Science Writing Instruction</FONT>
(September 2014 - August 2017)</h4>
<p>The ability to express scientific ideas in both written and oral form is an important 21st century skill. Teachers, employers, and college faculty lament the inability of many high school graduates to write clearly. This deficit in writing is due in part because teachers do not have the time to provide appropriate, timely feedback to students on their writing. This project would help teachers help students achieve these skills through automating an effective feedback process, in ways that are customized to particular disciplines and local classroom needs, particularly in high needs districts. The project will contribute to knowledge about how students learn to write and how computer assisted systems can support this learning.
<p>
This project will develop and test three tools: 1) Teaching resources organized as developmental trajectories for teachers to use (e.g. from more simple to more complex; with diagnostics and strategies for addressing particular challenges); 2) A teacher dashboard that uses Artificial Intelligence tools to provide timely formative assessment to teachers by highlighting problem areas in their students' writing and peer reviews; and 3) An online teacher resource exchange to rapidly grow the set of appropriate assignments that can be used with this approach, critically filtered by student performance metrics. The project builds on a current system called SWoRD, which supports student peer reviewing in many disciplines within and beyond science. Working with six lead teachers and larger set of pilot teachers, the project will develop a trajectory of effective writing assignments in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. In year three, there will be a summative evaluation with 90 teachers.

<ul><h4><FONT color=purple> Computational Models of Essay Rewritings
</FONT>
(September 2015 - August 2017)</h4>
<p>
This project evaluates the viability of revision as a pedagogical
technique by determining whether student interactions with an NLP-based
revision assistant enables them to learn to write better -- that is, whether certain forms of the 
feedback (in terms of the perceived
purposes and scopes of changes) 
encourage students to learn to make more effective revisions. More 
specifically, the project works toward three objectives:
(1) Define a schema for characterizing the types of changes that occur
at different levels of the rewriting. For example, the writer might
add one or more sentences to provide evidence to support a thesis; or
the writer might add just one or two words to make a phrase more
precise.
(2) Based on the schema, design a computational model for recognizing
the purpose and scope of each change within a revision. One
application of such a model is a revision assistant that serves as a
sounding board for students as they experiment with different revision
alternatives.
(3) Conduct experiments to study the interactions between students and
the revision writing environment in which variations of idealized
computational models are simulated. The findings of the experiments
pave the way for developing better technologies to support for student
learning. This NSF grant is in collaboration with

<h4><FONT color=purple>Adding Spoken Language to a Text-Based Dialogue
Tutor</FONT> (Nov. 2003 - Sep. 2006)</h4>
<p>
The goal of this research is to generate an
empirically-based understanding of the ramifications of adding spoken
language capabilities to text-based dialogue tutors, and to understand
how these implications might differ in human-human and human-computer
spoken interactions.  This research will explore the relative effectiveness
of speech versus text-based tutoring in the context of ITSPOKE, a
speech-based dialogue system that uses a text-based system for
tutoring conceptual physics (VanLehn et al, 2002) as its
``back-end.''  The results of this work will demonstrate whether
spoken dialogues yield increased performance compared to text with
respect to a variety of evaluation measures, whether the same or
different student and tutor behaviors correlate with learning gains in
speech and text, and how such findings generalize both across and
within human and computer tutoring conditions.  These results will
impact the development of future dialogue tutoring systems
incorporating speech, by highlighting the performance gains that can
be expected, and the requirements for achieving such gains.

The focus of our proposed work
is to provide an infrastructure that will allow learning researchers
to study dialogue in new ways and for educational technology
researchers to quickly build dialogue based help systems for their
tutoring systems. Most tutorial dialogue systems that to date have
undergone successful evaluations (CIRCSIM, AutoTutor, WHY-Atlas, the
Geometry Explanation Tutor) represent development efforts of many
man-years. These systems were instrumental in pushing the technology
forward and in proving that tutorial dialogue systems are feasible and
useful in realistic educational contexts, although not always provably
better on a pedagogical level than the more challenging alternatives
to which they have been compared. We are now entering a new phase in
which we as a research community must not only continue to improve the
effectiveness of basic tutorial dialogue technology but also provide
tools that support investigating the effective use of dialogue as a
learning intervention as well as application of tutorial dialogue
systems by those who are not dialogue system researchers. We propose
to develop a community resource to address all three of these problems
on a grand scale, building upon our prior work developing both basic
dialogue technology and tools for rapid development of running
dialogue systems. This grant is led by

<h4><FONT color=purple>Does Treating Student Uncertainty as a Learning
Impass Improve Learning in Spoken Dialogue Tutoring</FONT> (Oct. 2006 - May 2007)</h4>

<p>
Most existing tutoring systems respond based only on the correctness
of student answers. Although the tutoring community has shown that
incorrectness and uncertainty both represent learning impasses (and
thus opportunities to learn), and has also shown correlations between
uncertainty and learning, to date there have been very few controlled
experiments investigating whether system responses to student
uncertainty improve learning. We thus propose a small controlled study
to test whether this hypothesis holds true, under "ideal" system
conditions. The study uses a Wizard of Oz (WOZ) version of a
qualitative physics spoken dialogue tutoring system, where the human
Wizard performs speech recognition, natural language understanding,
and recognition of uncertainty, for each student answer. In the
experimental condition, the Wizard then tells the system that correct
but uncertain answers are incorrect, causing the system to respond to
both uncertain and incorrect student answers in the same way, namely
with further dialogue, thereby reinforcing the student's
understanding of the principle(s) under discussion. In the first
control condition, the system responds only to incorrect student
answers in this way. In the second control condition, the
system responds to a percentage of correct answers in this way, to
control for the additional tutoring in the experimental
condition.

Monitoring Student State in Tutorial Spoken Dialogue</FONT> (Sep. 2003
 - Aug. 2007)</H4>
<p>
This research investigates the feasibility and utility of monitoring
student emotions in spoken dialogue tutorial systems. While human
tutors respond to both the content of student utterances and
underlying perceived emotions, most tutorial dialogue systems cannot
detect student emotions, and furthermore are text-based, which may
limit their success at emotion prediction. While there has been
increasing interest in identifying problematic emotions
(e.g. frustration, anger) in spoken dialogue applications such as call
centers, little work has addressed the tutorial domain.  The PIs are
investigating the use of lexical, syntactic, dialogue, prosodic and
acoustic cues to enable a computer tutor to automatically predict and
respond to student emotions. The research is being performed in the
context of ITSPOKE, a speech-based tutoring dialogue system for
conceptual physics. The PIs are recording students interacting with
ITSPOKE, manually annotating student emotions in these as well as in
human-human dialogues, identifying linguistic and paralinguistic cues
to the annotations, and using machine learning to predict emotions
from potential cues. The PIs are then deriving strategies for adapting
the system's tutoring based upon emotion identification.
The major scientific contribution will be an understanding of whether
cues available to spoken dialogue systems can be used to predict
emotion, and ultimately to improve tutoring performance. The results
will be of value to other applications that can benefit from
monitoring emotional speech. Progress towards closing the performance
gap between human tutors and current machine tutors will also expand
the usefulness of current computer tutors.  This grant is in

<h4><FONT color=purple>Tutoring Scientific Explanations via Natural
Language Dialogue</FONT> (project <a
href="http://andes3.lrdc.pitt.edu/ITR/tsed.html">homepage</a>)
(Jan. 2004 - Dec. 2007)
</h4>
<p>
It is widely acknowledged, both in academic studies and the
marketplace, that the most effective form of education is the
professional human tutor. A major difference between human tutors and
computer tutors is that only human tutors understand unconstrained
natural language input. Recently, a few tutoring systems have been
developed that carry on a natural language (NL) dialogue with
students. Our research problem is to find ways to make NL-based
tutoring systems more effective. Our basic approach is to derive new
dialogue strategies from studies of human tutorial dialogues,
incorporate them in an NL-based tutoring system, and determine if they
make the tutoring system more effective. For instance, some studies
are determining if learning increases when human tutors are
constrained to follow certain strategies. In order to incorporate the
new dialogue strategies into our existing text and spoken NL-based
tutoring systems, two completely new modules are being developed. One
new module will interpret student utterances using a large directed
graph of propositions called an explanation network, which is halfway
between the shallow and deep representations of knowledge that are
currently used. The second new module uses machine learning to improve
the selection of dialogue management strategies. The research is thus
a multidisciplinary effort whose intellectual merit lies in new
results in the cognitive psychology of human tutoring, in the
technology of NL processing, and in the design of effective tutoring
systems. Improved NL-based tutoring systems could have a broad impact
on education and society.  This grant is in

<h4><FONT color=purple>Cohesion in Tutorial Dialogue and its Impact on
Learning</FONT> (Oct. 2006 - June 2009)</h4>
<p>
Research on the factors that make one-on-one tutoring a very effective
mode of instruction has converged on an important finding: that the
critical term in "tutorial interaction" is "interaction." That is,
what the tutor says or does during tutoring, and what the student says
or does are less important than the dynamic, coordinated interplay
between their dialogue turns.  It is now important to identify the
discourse mechanisms that drive highly interactive human tutoring, so
that these mechanisms can be simulated by natural-language dialogue
engines in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs).  In the first stage of
this project, we will analyze a corpus of naturalistic tutorial
dialogues to accomplish this goal.  Specifically, we will identify the
mechanisms that achieve cohesion in tutorial dialogues, since highly
interactive tutorial dialogue is intrinsically highly cohesive.  In
the second stage, we will run a series of controlled studies to test
the hypothesis that more highly cohesive tutorial dialogue is more
effective for promoting learning than less cohesive dialogue, and to
assess the effectiveness of a few selected mechanisms of cohesion.
Finally, in the third stage of the project, we will explore the extent
to which database tools developed by the computational linguistics
community (e.g., WordNet and FrameNet) can automatically tag cohesion
in tutorial dialogue.  We will also extend these tools and develop
algorithms that will allow them to be used to automatically generate
cohesive tutor turns for a small sample of student turns, as a first
step towards developing a natural-language dialogue engine that can
use these tools to generate highly cohesive tutorial dialogue.

SWoRD is a web-based system to support peer reviewing in a wide variety of
disciplinary classroom settings. One result of prior research with SWoRD
is an enormous database of written materials that are ripe for analysis
and exploitation in support of research on natural language processing
(NLP), intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), cognitive science, educational
data mining, and improving learning from peer review.  In this project we
will both analyze existing SWoRD-generated data, and develop an improved
version of SWoRD for use in further experimentation.  In particular, we
will explore using SWoRD to teach substantive skills in domains involving
ill-defined problems, and will explore techniques for automatically
identifying key concepts and flagging issue understanding. Second, given a
SWoRD toolkit of what can be accomplished robustly with peer interactions,
we will explore the use of natural language processing to automatically
support and improve those interactions.  Finally, we will develop a new
version of the SWoRD program that incorporates improved features and
control facilities, and that incorporates Artificial Intelligence
techniques to improve learning in a variety of ways.  This is an internal LRDC grant, and is in collaboration with

<h4><FONT color=purple>Adapting to Student Uncertainty over and above Correctness in A Spoken Tutoring Dialogue System
</FONT> (Sep. 2006 - Aug. 2011)</h4>
<p>
This research investigates whether responding to student uncertainty
over and above correctness improves learning during computer
tutoring. The investigation is performed in the context of a spoken
dialogue tutoring system, where student speech provides many
linguistic cues (e.g. intonation, pausing, word usage) that
computational linguistics research suggests can be used to detect
uncertainty. Intelligent tutoring systems research suggests that
uncertainty is part of the learning process, and has hypothesized that
to increase system effectiveness, it is critical to respond to more
than correctness. However, most existing tutoring systems respond only
to student correctness, and few controlled experiments have yet
investigated whether also responding to uncertainty can improve
learning.
This research designs and implements two different enhancements to the
spoken dialogue tutoring system, to test two hypotheses in the
tutoring literature concerning how tutors can effectively respond to
uncertainty over and above correctness. The first hypothesis is that
student uncertainty and incorrectness both represent learning
impasses, i.e., opportunities to improve understanding. This
hypothesis is addressed with an enhanced system version that treats
uncertainty in the same way that incorrectness is currently treated
(i.e., with additional subdialogue to increase understanding). The
second hypothesis is that more optimal responses can be developed by
modeling how human tutor responses to correctness change when the
student is uncertain. This hypothesis is addressed by analyzing human
tutor dialogue act responses (i.e. content and presentation) to
student uncertainty over and above correctness in an existing tutoring
corpus, then implementing these responses in a second enhanced system
version. Two controlled experiments are then performed. The first
tests the relative impact of the two adaptations on learning using a
Wizard of Oz version of the system, with a human (Wizard) detecting
uncertainty and performing speech recognition and language
understanding. The second experiment tests the impact of the
best-performing adaptation from the first experiment in the context of
the real system, with the system processing the speech and language
and detecting uncertainty in a fully automated manner.
The major intellectual contribution of the research is to demonstrate
whether significant improvements in learning are achieved by adapting
to student uncertainty over and above correctness during tutoring, to
advance the state of the art by fully automating and evaluating user
uncertainty detection and adaptation in a working spoken dialogue
system, and to investigate any different effects of this adaptation
under ideal versus actual system conditions.

<h4><FONT color=purple> Improving a Natural-language Tutoring System
That Engages Students in Deep Reasoning Dialogues About Physics</FONT>
(<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~rimac">project homepage</a>) (June 2010-May 2013)

</h4>
<p>
Recent studies show that U.S. students lag behind students in other developed countries in math and science. Because one-on-one tutoring has been shown to be a highly effective form of instruction, many educators and education policy makers have looked to intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) as a means of providing cost-effective, individualized instruction to students that can improve their conceptual understanding of, and problem-solving skills in, math and science. However, even though many ITSs have been shown to be effective, they are still not as effective as human tutors. 
<p>The goal of this Cognition and Student Learning development project is to take a step towards meeting President Obama's challenge to produce "learning software as effective as a personal tutor." We will do this by building an enhanced version of a natural-language dialogue system that engages students in deep-reasoning, reflective dialogues after they solve quantitative problems in Andes, an intelligent tutoring system for physics. Improvements to this system will focus on addressing a key limitation of natural-language (NL) tutoring systems: although these systems are "interactive" in the sense that they try to elicit explanations from students instead of lecturing to them, automated tutors do not align their dialogue turns with those of the student to the same degree, and in the same ways, that human tutors do. In particular, automated tutors often fail to reuse parts of the student's dialogue turns in their own turns, to adjust the level of abstraction that the student is working from when the student is over-generalizing or missing important distinctions between concepts, and to abstract or specialize correct student input when doing so might enhance the student's understanding. Empirical research shows that these forms of lexical and semantic alignment in human tutoring predict learning. The main outcome of this development effort will be a fully working, prototype reflective dialogue version of Andes that can carry out these functions and serve as a research platform for a future study that compares the effectiveness of the enhanced NL tutoring system with the current system, which lacks these alignment capabilities--thereby allowing us to test the hypothesis that it is not interaction per se that explains the effectiveness of human tutoring, but how it is carried out.
<p> The enhanced version of this reflective dialogue system will be developed through an iterative process of preparing a prototype for experienced physics teachers and students to try out using the "Wizard of Oz" paradigm, identifying cases in which the system does not work as intended (e.g., the tutor prompts the student to generalize or make distinctions when this is not warranted by the discourse context), refining the software to correct these problems, and testing the revised software in a subsequent field trial. The subject pool for these trials will be students enrolled in a first-year physics course at the University of Pittsburgh and high school students taking physics in Pittsburgh urban and suburban schools. During the third (final) year of the project, we will collect pilot data that addresses the feasibility of implementing the system in authentic high school physics classes, and the promise of the system to increase students' conceptual understanding of physics and ability to solve physics problems. The latter will be determined by comparing students' pre- and post-test performance on measures of conceptual understanding and problem-solving ability in physics, and by comparing the performance of students who use the current and enhanced version of the system on these measures.

From the instructor's viewpoint, a class writing assignment is a black box. Until instructors actually read the first or final drafts, they do not have much information about how well the assignment has succeeded as a pedagogical activity, and even then, it is hard to get a complete picture. Computer-supported peer review systems such as SWoRD, a scaffolded peer review system can help students to write higher quality compositions in classroom assignments, can help in this regard. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate methods to provide instructors with a comprehensive overview of the progress of a class writing assignment in terms of how well students understand the issues based on structured reviewing rubrics, feedback students provide and receive in the peer review process, and machine learning computational lingustics analysis of the resulting texts. The SWoRD-based peer-review system will present the instructor's overview via a kind of "Teacher-side Dashboard" that will summarize salient information for the class as a whole, cluster students based on common features of their texts, and enable instructors to delve into particular student's writings more effectively in a guided manner.

RI: Small: An Affect-Adaptive Spoken Dialogue System that Responds Based on User Model and Multiple Affective States 
</FONT> (September 2009 - August 2013)</h4>
<p>

There has been increasing interest in affective dialogue systems, motivated by the belief that in human-human dialogues, participants seem to be (at least to some degree) detecting and responding to the emotions, attitudes and metacognitive states of other participants. The goal of the proposed research is to improve the state of the art in affective spoken dialogue systems along three dimensions, by drawing on the results of prior research in the wider spoken dialogue and affective system communities. First, prior research has

shown that not all users interact with a system in the same way; the proposed research hypothesizes that employing different affect adaptations for users with different domain aptitude levels will yield further performance improvement in affective spoken dialogue systems. Second, prior research has shown that users display a range of affective states and attitudes while interacting with a system; the proposed research hypothesizes that adapting to multiple user states will yield further performance improvement in affective spoken dialogue systems. Third, while prior research has shown preliminary performance gains for affect adaptation in semi-automated dialogue systems, similar gains have not yet been realized in fully automated systems. The proposed research will use state of the art empirical methods to build fully automated affect detectors. It is hypothesized that both fully and semi-automated versions of a dialogue systemthat either adapts to affect differently depending on user class, or that adapts to multiple user affective states, can improve performance compared to non-adaptive counterparts, with semi-automation generating the most improvement. The three hypotheses will be investigated in the context of an existing spoken dialogue tutoring system that adapts to the user state of uncertainty. The task domain is conceptual physics typically covered in a first-year physics course (e.g., Newtons Laws, gravity, etc.). To investigate the first hypothesis, a first enhanced system version will be developed; it will use the existing uncertainty adaptation for lower aptitude users with respect to domain knowledge, and a new uncertainty adaptation will be developed and implemented to be employed for higher aptitude users. To investigate the second hypothesis, a second enhanced systemversion will be developed; it will use the existing uncertainty adaptation for all turns displaying uncertainty, and a new disengagement adaptation will be developed and implemented to be employed for all student turns displaying a second state of disengagement. A controlled experiment with the two enhanced systems will then be conducted in a Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) setup, with a human Wizard detecting affect and performing speech recognition and language understanding. To investigate the third hypothesis, a second controlled experiment will be conducted, which replaces the WOZ system versions with fully-automated systems.
<p>
The major intellectual contribution of this research will be to demonstrate whether significant performance gains can be achieved in both partially and fully-automated affective spoken dialogue tutoring systems 1) by adapting to user uncertainty based on user aptitude levels, and 2) by adapting to multiple user states hypothesized to be of primary importance within the tutoring domain, namely uncertainty and disengagement. The research project will thus advance the state of the art in both spoken dialogue and computer tutoring technologies, while at the same time demonstrating any differing effects of affect-adaptive systems under ideal versus realistic conditions. More broadly, the research and resulting technology will lead to more natural and effective spoken dialogue-based systems, both for tutoring as well as for more traditional information-seeking domains. In addition, improving the performance of computer tutors will expand their usefulness and thus have substantial benefits for education and society.
