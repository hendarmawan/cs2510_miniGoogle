<blockquote>The work of Senior Manager is to initiate the project and get
status as project progresses.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><i><font face="Arial">PlanView:</font></i></b></blockquote>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
The Senior Manager first launches a new project. For that he launches his
browser and signs on to his companys PlanView Extranet to get
his unique, personalized web portal, HomeView.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
Using the web, he can initialize work – projects or service requests –
from anywhere in the world. He clicks on the Manage Portfolio FeatureSet.
The interface is intuitive PlanView, and he uses a wizard to walk him easily
through the requesting process. PlanView's project budgeting features let
him input cost estimates now that will be tracked and updated as the project
continues.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
PlanView captures his request into the PlanView central repository of all
work and resource data It also puts the new project into that manager's
portfolio of work and sends an alert message to Project manager.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
The Senior Manager launches his HomeView later to check progress on his
projects and service requests in real-time over the web. He considers his
work requests his "portfolio." He can sort his portfolio by priority, status,
request date, etc., so he can make informed decisions. So his decision
making is rarely a bottleneck on fast-moving projects.<br>
<BR></li>
</ol>
<b><i><font face="Arial">WebProject:</font></i></b><br>
<BR>
<ol>
<li>
The first step is going to be the same like in PlanView. WebProject is
also an Extranet. So Senior manager can log on to his personalized WebProject.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
Then he can open Documentor page to create and edit project web pages, 
which the Project Manager can View. He can also use User Profiles web to
define new users, edit the permissions.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
There are no internal alert messages. Senior Manager sends a message
explicitly.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
Later on the senior manager can get a top level overview of project status
in the Executive Information System (EIS). In EIS, he can drill down through
subproject levels and get the information. Since there no facility to sort
his portfolio and he has to do it, there is possibility of bottleneck</li>
