<h2>Description:</h2> 

<blockquote>
NLP-based applications in educational environments continue to
develop
at a fast pace. Initial work began as early as the 1960's on
evaluating written essay-length and short-answer assessments,
text-based intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), and proofreading
tools. These fields continue to progress using innovative NLP
techniques - statistical, rule-based, or some combination of the
two. More recently, new technologies have made it possible to include
speech in both assessment and ITS. Using a somewhat different
approach, NLP techniques are being used to generate assessments and
tools for curriculum development. As a community we are not only
improving existing capabilities, but identifying and generating
innovative and creative ways to use NLP in applications for writing,
reading, speaking, and critical thinking.

 NLP for Building Educational Applications, 2009]</i>

<h2>Academic Integrity:</h2> 

<p>If you include material from any source in
your presentation and/or projects, you must acknowledge it. Your
presentations and projects should represent your (and your partner's,
if applicable) original work.

<h2>Students with Disabilities:</h2> 

<p>If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and
Disability Resources and Services, 216 William Pitt Union, (412)
648-7890/(412) 383-7355 (TTY), as early as possible in the term.  DRS
will verify your disability and determine reasonable accomodations for
this course.
