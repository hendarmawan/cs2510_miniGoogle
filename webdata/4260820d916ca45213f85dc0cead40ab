<H1>Prosodic Analysis of Misrecognitions and Corrections in Spoken Dialogues</H1>
<p>
Understanding how people speak when they interact with spoken dialogue
systems is critical to improving the performance of those systems.  
For example, previous research
has found that user attempts to correct system errors are themselves
more likely to be misrecognized than other utterances, and thus may
require special handling.  
Knowing whether speakers are more likely to
repeat or rephrase their utterances, add new information or shorten
their input, and how system behavior influences these choices can
suggest appropriate on-line modifications to a dialogue system's
interaction strategy or to the recognition procedures it employs.
<p>
This research investigates whether speakers' prosodic behavior
provides useful indicators of a) whether a speaker turn will be
recognized correctly or not by an automatic speech recognition system;
b) whether a speaker is reacting to a system error; and c) whether a
speaker is correcting such an error.  Our analytic results show that
there are significant prosodic and lexical differences between
misrecognized and correctly recognized speech and between correction
and non-correction utterances.  In addition, the characteristics of
correction utterances vary with system interaction strategy.  Our
machine learning results show that prosodic and other differences can
in fact be used to automatically predict both misrecognitions and
their corrections. We are exploring how to use our results to improve
spoken dialogue system behavior.
