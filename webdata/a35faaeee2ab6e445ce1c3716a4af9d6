Comments:
(i) We can start from Step 1 to specify the IC cards.

<p>
(ii) If the IC cards are already specified, we can start
from Step 2 to specify the interactions between IC cards.

<p>
(iii) If the interactions are already
specified, we can start from Step 3 to specify
the IC system.

<p>

(iii) Specification of context. Some can be absorbed within the IC (i.e.
in terms of f and g).  But some may be explict, i.e. time,
weather,etc.
