          <p>You can download it from <a href="src/VCRMobile.VSNET2003.zip">here</a></p>
          <p>The following structure is present:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>IVCRRemote</strong>: The project to create a class library that is need for both, the Remote Object and the ASP.NET web site</li>
            <li><strong>NameServerConnector</strong>: The J# Connector which interacts with both the Name Server and the actual Virtual Classroom. The name is misleading becuase at the beginning I was planning to create to separate objects: one for connecting to the name server and the other for connecting to the VC</li>
            <li><strong>NameSvrTestClient</strong>: A console application that connects directly to the Remote Object. It was developed to facilitate the debugging (the name is also misleading) </li>
            <li><strong>VCRMobile</strong>: The J# ASP.NET application </li>
            </ul>          
          <p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
          <p>Copy the VCRMobile folder to &lt;x&gt;:\inetpub\wwwroot and then create an application using Internet Information Services MMC (microsoft management console). &lt;X:&gt; is usually the drive C: </p>
          <p>Build and run the NameServerConnector project in Visual Studio. A reference must be made to include the IVCRemote interface in both the the Connector and the web site </p>          <p><strong>Bonus!</strong></p>
          <p>A reduced version of the Java version of the Virtual Classroom is available. Download it from <a href="src/VJConsole.zip">here</a>. It is made in J# and does not need any JDK. Although it's labeled as a &quot;Console&quot; application, you can change the type of the project to Windows Application in Visual Studio .NET 2003. The Console target was choosen to see the debugging messages in a console but it is not required </p>
          <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Microsoft .NET 1.1 SDK or Visual Studio .NET 2003</li>
            <li>Internet Information Server </li>
