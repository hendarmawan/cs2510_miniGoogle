<blockquote>Whenever there is a new project by Senior Manager, the work
of Project Manager is to check the scope, to plan and to allocate resources.
<p><b><i><font face="Arial">PlanView:</font></i></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
As soon as the Project Manager log on to HomeView, the Extranet, there
is a system generated Alerts tells him that he has a new project to
scope and plan.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
He can access the Resource Search Engine to search for resources like who
has the skills he needs and who are available. Then by using the
PlanViews CPM
engine, he can get the initial schedule. Over booking will be taken
take of the Resource Search Engine.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
But to get the Gantt Chart or Network, he has to use Microsoft Project,
which has a bi-directional link with PlanView.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
After he approves the Timesheets, the system will send ‘Alert’ messages
to those individuals notifying them about their new work.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
No clear information as to how Project Manager keeps track of the progress
of project. Maintaining Timesheets is one way. <br>
<BR></li>
</blockquote>
<b><i><font face="Arial">WebProject:</font></i></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
After Senior Manager initiated the project, Project Manager use
PlanTrack to
create new project schedules and task outlines, assign resources, edit
task descriptions and define subprojects. He can create projects from scratch
or from previously defined templates.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
Then he can create a Histogram and can view the resources assignments across
multiple projects. Easy to use filters let him see exactly the
information that he wants to see.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
This is only way, he will know about resources, that is like who is available
and who are right from his needs. But this not so clear about How the Project
Manager will about resources available.</li>
<BR></li>

<li>
No Gannt Charts or Networks. But the PlanTrack and Communicator will show
the scheduling details like the duration of tasks and deadlines.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
PlanTracks and Communicatior can be used for online-meeting and Chats,
through which the project Manager will communicate.</li>
