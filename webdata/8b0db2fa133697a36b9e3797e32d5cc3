<h2>Incorporation of other businesses' services</h2>

<p><font size="4">Small business usually have small budgets.
Thus, the less they have to spend in developing their their own
web site or application, the better. Various tasks, such as
identify confirmation, credit card checking and billing, and the
like are common to many small business. These types of services
are ideal for exposure as a web service. Companies that
specialize in those areas, perhaps the credit company itself,
could expose these services over the Internet for usage by
customers. And bill for the service too, but this is more or less
irrelavent from the client's standpoint since they'd be paying
for it anyway. The difference is, they can now directly integrate
that functionality into their own service in a way not before
possible - increasing their value to their own users.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Small business in turn can do the same -
develop highly specialized surfaces that others don't have and
provide them to larger businesses. And make money doing it. These
services may even use that other business's data - all readable
because of XML.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Web sites no longer need be an &quot;island&quot;
- they can enjoy all the power that collaboration can bring.</font></p>

<h2>Data anywhere</h2>

<p><font size="4">Finally, through software as a service and .NET
businesses can benefit by making their data and processing
available not only to other applications, but to other devices. A
smaller software module can be developed to run on a PDA like a
Palm pilot. This too can access the full functionality of the
business's web services - and so for a much cheaper development
cost, they've just added an entire new potential customer base to
their site.</font></p>
