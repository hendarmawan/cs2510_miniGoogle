<br><i><b><u>Icons</u></b></i><br>
Icons are images of objects that represents mainly concepts.
An icon X is seen as a pair (Xm,Xi) where Xm represents the meaning of the icon, or the logical part, 
and Xi represents the image, or the physical part.<br>
An icon image contains both global and local features. A global feature of an icon represents the 
primary concept expressed by the image, whereas a local feature represents a secondary concept. 
Therefore, the meaning part Xm of an icon X is in general a conceptual structure. <br>
<br>
<i><b><u>Icon Algebra</u></b></i><br>
For semantic combination of icons we exploit the theory of Icon Algebra.<br>
The icon operators are defined below, where X and Y are the 
operand icons and Z is the resultant composite icon.  In what follows, X.[u]A 
means X has an attribute u whose value is A.  If A has again an attribute v 
whose value is B, we write X.[u]A.[v]B.  The primary meaning P of the icon X is
usually denoted by X.[is]P, although any X.[u]P could be made to be the primary
meaning of X. We often use the primary meaning P to refer to the conceptual 
structure X<sub>m</sub>, and write X = (P, X<sub>i</sub>).<br><br>
<i><u><b>Icon Operators</b></u></i><br>
1. Combination COM: COM (X,Y) <br>
The COM operator performs the conceptual merge of the meanings associated with the individual icons X and Y.<br>
For eg. X.[is]EYE that denotes "personal communication" and Y.[is]CROSSED FLAGS denoting "start of race". So COM(X,Y) denotes "greetings".

<br><br><br>

2. Marking MAR: MAR (X,Y) <br>
The marking operator marks the image of the icon Y with the image of the icon X to emphasize a local feature. Here the first icon plays the role of "marker image".<br>
For eg. X.[is]GLOBE.[quality]space and Y.[is]DRAFTSMAN. Y marks X and the concept derived is "PEOPLE".<br><br>
