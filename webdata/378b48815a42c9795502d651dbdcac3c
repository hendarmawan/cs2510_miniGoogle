<h1>EXTENDING VISUAL LANGUAGES FOR MULTIMEDIA</h1>

Visual languages, which let users customize iconic sentences, can be extended to 
accommodate multimedia objects, letting users access media dynamically. Teleaction 
objects, or multimedia objects with knowledge structures, can be designed using visual 
languages to automatically respond to events and perform tasks like <b>find related books</b>
in virtual library Bookman.<br>


<p>
Languages that let users create custom icons and iconic sentences are receiving increased 
attention as multimedia applications become more prevalent. Visual language systems let 
the user introduce new icons, and create iconic sentences with different meanings and the  
ability to exhibit dynamic behavior. With a graphical user interface, the user must 
generally compose commands with predefined icons, which limits the range of 
commands and makes dynamic composition rather difficult. It is also awkward to 
customize such commands without cluttering the screen. These limitations are significant 
in multimedia applications because the user must often access multimedia information 
dynamically with very few icons.<br>

At the University of Pittsburgh and Knowledge Systems Institute, we have developed a 
formal framework for visual language semantics that is based on the notion of icon 
algebra and have designed several visual languages for the speech impaired. The <a href="#apndx"> appendix</a> 
describes more about the underlying semantics and grammar.  We have since 
extended the framework to include the design of multidimensional languages - visual 
languages that capture the dynamic nature of multimedia objects through icons, earcons 
(sound), micons (motion icons), and vicons (video icons). The user can create a 
multimedia message by combining these icons and have direct access to multimedia 
information, including animation. <br>

We have successfully implemented this framework in developing <a href="http://www.ksi.edu/vrlib/vrlib.html"> Bookman </a>, an interface 
to a virtual library used by the students and faculty of the Knowledge Systems Institute. 
As part of this work, we extended the visual language concepts to develop teleaction 
objects, objects that automatically respond to some events or messages to perform certain 
tasks [CHHC95]. We are continuing work on extensions to the visual interface in the 
context of emergency management, where the information system must react to flood 
warnings, fire warnings, and so on, to present multimedia information and to take actions 
[KHALIFA96].<br>

Figure 1 shows the search and query flexibility possible with the Bookman interface. In 
addition, users can perform a range of tasks, including finding related books,  finding 
books containing documents similar to documents contained in the current book,   
receiving alert messages when related books or books containing similar documents have 
been prefetched by BookMan, finding other users with similar interests or receiving alert 
messages about such users (the last function requires mutual consent among the users) 
etc.  In developing the interface, our goal was to give users the same range of freedom 
they might experience in a real library. Much of this power stems from the use of TAOs.<br>

<h2>WHAT TELEACTION OBJECTS DO</h2>
To create a TAO, we attached knowledge about events to the structure of each 
multimedia obobject - a complex object that comprises some combination of text, image, 
graphics, video, and audio objects. TAOs are extremely valuable because they greatly 
improve the selective access and presentation of relevant multimedia information. In 
BookMan, for example, each book or multimedia document is a TAO because the user 
can not only access the book, browse its table of contents, read its abstract, and decide 
whether to check it out, but also be informed about related books, or find out who has a 
similar interest in this subject. The user can indicate an intention by incrementally 
modifying the physical appearance of the book, usually with just a few clicks of the 
mouse.<br>

TAOs can accommodate an almost limitless range of functions. For example, when the 
user clicks on a particular book, it can automatically access information about related 
books and create a multimedia presentation from all the books.

The drawback of TAOs is that they are complex objects and  therefore the end user can 
not easily manipulate them with traditional define, insert, delete, modify, and update 
commands. Instead, TAOs require direct manipulation, which we provided through a 
multidimensional language. <br>

<h2>ELEMENTS OF A TELEACTION OBJECT</h2>
The physical appearance of a TAO is described by a multidimensional sentence. The 
syntactic structure derived from this multidimensional sentence controls its dynamic 
multimedia presentation. The TAO also has a knowledge structure called the active index 
that controls its event-driven or message-driven behavior. The multidimensional sentence 
may be location-sensitive, time-sensitive or content-sensitive. Thus, an incremental 
change in the TAO’s external appearance is an event that causes the active index to react. 
As I describe later, the active index itself can be designed using a visual-language 
approach.<br>

<h3>Multidimensional language</h3>
The multidimensional language consists of generalized icons and operators, and each 
sentence has a syntactic structure that controls the dynamics of a multimedia 
presentation.<br>

<h3>Generalized icons and operators</h3>
The <a href="#apndx"> appendix</a> <b>Elements of a visual language</b> describes the icons and operators in a visual 
(not multidimensional) language. In a multidimensional language, we want not only 
icons that represent objects by images, but also icons that represent the different types of 
media. We call such primitives generalized icons and define them as  x = (x<font size=-2>m</font>, x<font size=-2>p</font>) where 
x<font size=-2>m</font> is the meaning and x<font size=-2>p</font> is the physical appearance. To represent TAOs, we replace the x<font size=-2>p</font> 
with other expressions that depend on the media type:<br>
<br>
o	Icon: (x<font size=-2>m</font>, x<font size=-2>i</font>) where x<font size=-2>i</font> is an image <br>
o	Earcon: (x<font size=-2>m</font>, x<font size=-2>e</font>) where x<font size=-2>e</font> is sound<br>
o	Micon: (x<font size=-2>m</font>, x<font size=-2>s</font>) where x<font size=-2>s</font> is a sequence of icon images
              (motion icon)<br>
o	Ticon: (x<font size=-2>m</font>, x<font size=-2>t</font>) where x<font size=-2>t</font> is text (ticon can be regarded as a
               subtype of icon)<br>
o	Vicon: (x<font size=-2>m</font>, x<font size=-2>v</font>) where x<font size=-2>v</font> is a video clip (video icon)<br>

<br>
The combination of an icon and an earcon/micon/ticon/vicon is a multidimensional 
sentence. <br>

For multimedia TAOs, we define operators as <br>
o	Icon operator op = (op<font size=-2>m</font>, op<font size=-2>i</font>), such as ver (vertical composition), hor
             (horizontal composition), ovl (overlay), con (connect), surround, edge_to_edge,
             etc. <br>
o	Earcon operator op = (op<font size=-2>m</font>, op<font size=-2>e</font>), such as fade_in, fade_out, etc.  <br>
o	Micon operator op = (op<font size=-2>m</font>, op<font size=-2>s</font>), such as zoom_in, zoom_out, etc.  <br>
o	Ticon operator op = (op<font size=-2>m</font>, op<font size=-2>t</font>), such as text_merge, text_collate, 
              etc. <br>
o	Vicon operator op = (op<font size=-2>m</font>, op<font size=-2>v</font>), such as montage, cut, etc.<br>

Two classes of operators are possible in constructing a multimedia object.  As the <a href="#apndx"> appendix</a> 
<b>Elements of a visual language</b> describes, spatial operators are operators that involve 
spatial relations among image, text or other spatial objects. A multimedia object can also  
be constructed using operators that consider the passage of time. Temporal operators, 
which apply to earcons, micons, and vicons, make it possible to define the temporal 
relation [ALLEN83] among generalized icons. For example, if you want to watch a 
video clip and at the same time listen to the audio, you can request that the video co_start 
with the audio. Temporal operators for earcons, micons, ticons and vicons include 
co_start, co_end, overlap, equal, before, mee]t, and during and are usually treated as 
invisible operators because they are not visible in the multidimensional sentence.<br>

When you use temporal operators to combine generalized icons, their types may change. 
For example, a micon followed in time by another icon is still a micon, but the temporal 
composition of micon and earcon yields a vicon.  Media type changes are useful in 
adaptive multimedia so that one type of media may be replaced/combined/augmented by 
another type of media (or a mixture of media) for people with different sensory 
capabilities.<br>

We can add still more restrictions to create subsets of rules for icons, earcons, micons 
<br>and vicons that involve special operators: 
<br>o	For earcons, special operators include fade_in, fade_out,
<br>o	For micons, special operators include zoom_in, zoom_out,
<br>o	For ticons, special operators include text_collate, text_merge,
<br>o	For vicons, special operators include montage, cut.

These special operators support the combination of various types of generalized icons, 
which means the multidimensional language can fully reflect all multimedia types.<br>

<h3>Grammar</h3>
Multidimensional languages can handle temporal as well as spatial operators. A visual 
language has a relational grammar, G, which a compiler uses to generate sentences:<br>
		G = (N, X, OP, s, R)<br>
where N is the set of nonterminals,  X is the set of terminals (icons), OP is the set of 
spatial relational operators, s is the start symbol, and R is the set of production rules 
whose right side must be an expression involving relational operators.<br>

To describe multidimensional languages, we extended the X and OP elements of G: X is 
still the set of terminals but now includes earcons, micons, ticons, and vicons as well as 
icons, and the OP set now includes temporal as well as spatial relational operators.<br>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
Informally, a multidimensional language is a set of multidimensional sentences, each of 
which is the spatial/temporal composition of generalized icons. Figure 2 without the 
dialog box illustrates a simple visual sentence, which describes the physical appearance 
of a multimedia object retrieved by BookMan. With the dialogue box, the figure becomes 
a multidimensional sentence used by BookMan to generate <b>The children drive to school 
in the morning</b>. in synthesized speech. The multidimensional sentence has the syntactic 
structure<br>

  (DIALOG_BOX co_start SPEECH) ver (((CHILDREN hor CAR) hor       
   SCHOOL_HOUSE) hor SUNRISE)<br>

Figure 3 is a hypergraph of the syntactic structure. The syntactic structure is essentially a  
tree, but it has additional temporal operators (such as co_start) and spatial operators 
(such as hor and ver) indicated by dotted lines. Some operators may have more than two 
operands (for example, the co_start of audio, image, and text), which is why the structure 
is called a hypergraph. The syntactic structure controls the multimedia presentation of the 
TAO.<br>

Multidimensional languages must also account for multimedia dynamics because many 
media types vary with time. This means that a dynamic multidimensional sentence 
changes over time.<br>

We defined rules for spatial and temporal operators that let us transform the hypergraph 
in Figure 3 to a Petri net that controls the multimedia presentation. Figure 4 represents 
the Petri net of the sentence in Figure 2. As such, it also a representation of the dynamics 
of the multidimensional sentence in Figure 2. The multimedia presentation manager can 
execute this Petri net dynamically to create a multimedia presentation [LIN96]. For 
example, the presentation manager will produce the visual sentence in Figure 2 as well as 
the synthesized speech.<br>

<h3>Knowledge structure</h3>
An index cell is the fundamental building block of the active index, which is the key 
element of a TAO [CHANG95a].  Without the active index, a TAO would not be able to 
react to events or messages, and the dynamic visual language would lose its power.<br>

<h3>Cell communication</h3>
An index cell accepts input messages, performs some action, and posts an output message 
to a group of output index cells. Depending on its internal state and the input messages, 
the index cell can post different messages to different groups of output index cells. 
Therefore the connection between an index cell and its output cells is dynamic. For 
example, if a Bookman user wants to know about new books on nuclear winter, he 
modifies the visual sentence, causing TAO to send a message to activate a new index cell 
that will collect information on nuclear winter.<br>

An index cell can be either live or dead, depending on its internal state. The cell is live if 
the internal state is anything but the dead state. If the internal state is the dead state, the 
cell is dead. The entire collection of index cells, either live or dead, forms the index cell 
base. The set of live cells in the index cell base forms the active index.<br>

Each cell has a built-in timer that tells it to wait a certain time before deactivating (dead 
internal state). The timer is reinitialized each time the cell receives a new message and 
once again becomes active (live). When an index cell posts an output message to a group 
of output index cells, the output index cells become active. If an output index cell is in a 
dead state, the posting of the message will change it to the initial state, making it a live 
cell, and will initialize its timer. On the other hand, if the output index cell is already a 
live cell, the posting of the message will not affect its current state but will only 
reinitialize its timer.<br>

Active output index cells may or may not accept the posted message. The first output 
index cell that accepts the output message will remove this message from the output list 
of the current cell. (In a race, the outcome is nondeterministic.) If no output index cell 
accepts the posted output message, the message will stay indefinitely in the output list of 
the current cell. For example, if no index cells can provide the BookMan user with 
information about nuclear winter, the requesting message from the nuclear winter index 
cell will still be with this cell indefinitely. <br>

After its computation, the index cell may remain active (live) or deactivate (die). An 
index cell may also die if no other index cells (including itself) post messages to it. Thus 
the nuclear winter index cell in BookMan will die if not used for a long time, but will be 
reinitialized if someone actually wants such information and sends a message to it.<br>

Occasionally many index cells may be similar. For example, a user may want to attach an 
index cell to a document that upon detecting a certain feature sends a message to another 
index cell to prefetch other documents. If there are 10,000 such documents, there can be 
ten thousand similar index cells. The user can group these cells into an index cell type, 
with the individual cells as instances of that type. Therefore, although many index cells 
may be created, only a few index cell types need to be designed for a given application, 
thus simplifying the application designer’s task.<br>

<h3>Cell construction</h3>
To aid multimedia application designers in constructing index cells, we developed a 
visual-language-based tool, IC Builder, and used it to construct the index cells for the 
BookMan interface. Figure 5 shows a prefetch index cell being built. Prefetch is used 
with two other index cell types to retrieve documents [CHANG95a]. If the user selects 
the prefetch mode of the BookMan interface, the active index will activate the links to 
access information about related books. Prefetch is responsible for scheduling 
prefetching, initiating (issuing) a prefetching process to prefetch multimedia objects, and 
killing the prefetching process when necessary. <br>

Figure 5a shows the construction of the state-transition diagram. The prefetch index cell 
has two states: state 0, the initial and live state, and state -1, the dead state. The designer 
draws the state-transition diagram by clicking on the appropriate icons. In this example, 
the designer has clicked on the fourth vertical icon (zigzag line) to draw a transition from 
state 0 to state 0. Although the figure shows only two transition lines, the designer can 
specify as many transitions as necessary from state 0 to state 0.  Each transition could 
generate a different output message and invoke different actions. For example, the 
designer can represent different prefetching priority levels in BookMan by drawing 
different transitions.<br>

The designer wants to specify details about transition2 and so has highlighted it. Figure 
5b shows the result of clicking on the input message icon (top icon to the right of the 
State Transition Specification Dialog box.) IC Builder brings up the Input Message 
Specification Dialog box so that the designer can specify the input messages. The 
designer specifies message 1 (start_prefetch) input message. The designer could also 
specify a predicate, and the input message is accepted only if this predicate is evaluated 
true. Here there is no predicate, so the input message is always accepted.<br>

Figure 5c shows what happens if the designer clicks on the output message icon in Figure 
5a (bottom icon to the right of the State Transition Specification Dialog box). IC Builder 
brings up the Output Message Specification Dialog box so that the designer can specify 
actions, output messages, and output index cells. In this example, the designer has 
specified three actions: compute_schedule (determine the priority of prefetching 
information), issue_prefetch_proc (initiate a prefetch process), and store_pid  (Once a 
prefetch process is issued, its process id or pid is saved so that the process can be killed 
later if necessary).<br>

In the figure, there is no output message, but both input and output messages can have 
parameters. The index cell derives the output parameters from the input parameters.



<h2>DYNAMIC VISUAL LANGUAGE FOR QUERYING</h2>
When the user makes incremental changes to a multidimensional sentence, certain events 
occur and messages are sent to the active index. For example, suppose the user clicks on 
a book TAO to change the color attribute of the book. This is a select event, and the 
message select is sent to the active index. If the user creates a new related_info operation 
icon, this is a related_info event, and a message prefetch_related_info is sent to the active 
index. The incremental changes to a multidimensional sentence can be either:<br>
<br>
o	Location-sensitive. The location attribute of a generalized icon is changed.<br>
o	Time-sensitive. The time attribute of a generalized icon is changed.<br>
o	Content-sensitive. An attribute of a generalized icon other than a location or time 
attribute is changed or a generalized icon is added or deleted, or an operator is added or 
deleted.<br>

A visual sentence or multidimensional sentence can also be either location-sensitive, 
time-sensitive, or content-sensitive. The <a href="#apndx"> appendix</a> gives examples of different types of 
visual sentences. The resulting language is a dynamic visual language or dynamic 
multidimensional language.<br>

A dynamic visual language for virtual reality serves as a new paradigm in a querying 
system with multiple paradigms (form-based queries, diagram-based queries and so on) 
because it lets the user freely switch paradigms [CHANG94a]. When the user initially 
browses the virtual library, the VR query may be more natural; but when the user wants 
to find out more details, the form-based query may be more suitable. This freedom to 
switch back and forth among query paradigms gives the user the best of all worlds, and 
dynamic querying can be accomplished with greater flexibility. <br>

From the viewpoint of dynamic languages, a VR query is a location-sensitive 
multidimensional  sentence. As Figure 1b shows, BookMan indicates the physical 
locations of books by marked icons in a graphical presentation of the books stacks of the 
library. What users see is the same (with some simplification) as what they would 
experience in a real library. That is, the user selects a book by picking it from the shelf, 
inspects its contents and browses adjacent books on the shelf.<br>

In Figure 1a, initially the user is given the choice of query paradigms: search by title, 
author, ISBN, or keyword(s). If the user selects the virtual library search, he can then 
navigate in the virtual library, and as shown in Figure 1b, the result is a marked object. If 
the user switches to a form-based representation by clicking the <b>DetailedRecord</b> button, 
the result is an item in the form of Figure 1c. The user can now use the form to find 
books of interest, and switch back to the VR query paradigm by clicking the <b>VL 
location</b> button in Figure 1c. <br>

Essentially, the figure illustrates how the user can switch between a VR paradigm (such 
as the virtual library) and a logical paradigm (such as the form). <br>

There are certain admissability conditions for this switch. For a query in the logical 
paradigm to be admissable to the VR paradigm, the retrieval target object should also be 
an object in VR. For example, the virtual reality in the Bookman library is stacks of 
books, and an admissable query would be a query about books, because the result of that 
query can be indicated by marked book icons in the virtual library.<br>

Conversely, for a query in the VR paradigm to be admissable to the logical paradigm, 
there should be a single marked VR object that is also a database object, and the marking 
is achieved by an operation icon such as similar_to (find objects similar to this object), 
near (find objects near this object), above (find objects above this object), below (find 
objects below this object), and other spatial operators. For example, in the VR for the 
virtual library, a book marked by the operation icon similar_to is admissable and can be 
translated into the logical query <b>find all books similar to this book.</b><br>


<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
Visual query systems for multimedia databases, like Bookman, are under active 
investigation at many universities as well as industrial laboratories. These systems are 
extremely flexible. For example, a user can easily and quickly ask for any engineering 
drawing that contains a part that looks like the part in another drawing and that has a 
signature in the lower right corner that looks like John Doe’s signature. In fact, in our 
work on Bookman, we plan to build a mechanism that will let users create similarity 
retrieval requests that prompt Bookman to look for books similar to the book being 
selected.<br>

We are currently implementing the active index for BookMan to support optional modes 
like prefetching. We plan to extend BookMan to perform searches on the World Wide 
Web using a Web browser enhanced with an active index.[CHANG95a]. <br>

We have also used our multidimensional language framework to design user interfaces 
for personal digital assistants. The <a href="#apndx"> appendix</a> <b>Elements of a visual language</b> describes 
TimeMan, a personal assistant that performs time-management functions. Just as books 
in BookMan are teleaction objects, so are calendars in TimeMan. We used a 
multidimensional language to describe the external appearance of a TAO calendar, and 
provided an active index to manage to-do items. <br>

In summary, visual languages and multidimensional languages are useful in specifying 
the syntactic structure,  knowledge structure, and dynamic behavior  of complex 
multimedia objects such as TAO.  As multimedia applications become widespread, we 
expect to see more visual query systems in which multidimensional languages will play 
an important role, both as a theoretical foundation and as a means to explore new 
applications.<br>

<a name="apndx"><h2> APPENDIX: ELEMENTS OF A VISUAL LANGUAGE</h2></a>
A visual language is a pictorial representation of conceptual entities and operations and is 
essentially a tool through which users compose iconic, or visual, sentences 
[CHANG95b]. The icons generally refer to the physical image of an object. Compilers 
for visual languages must interpret visual sentences and translate them into a form that 
leads to the execution of the intended task [CHANG90]. This process is not 
straightforward. The compiler cannot determine the meaning of  the visual sentence 
simply by looking at the icons. It must also consider the context of the sentence, how the 
objects relate to one another. Keeping the user’s intent and the machine's interpretation 
the same is one of the most important tasks of a visual language [CRIMI90].<br>

<h3>Icons</h3>
A visual sentence is a spatial arrangement of object icons and/or operation icons that 
usually describes a complex conceptual entity or a sequence of operations. Object icons 
represent conceptual entities or groups of object icons that are arranged in a particular 
way. Operation icons, also called process icons, denote operations and are usually 
context-dependent. Figure A illustrates a visual sentence that consists of horizontally 
arranged icons, with a dialog box overlaid on it. This particular location-sensitive visual 
sentence  changes meaning when the locations of icons change, and can be used to 
specify to-do items for TimeMan, a time-management personal digital assistant. Figure B 
illustrates a content-sensitive visual sentence for TimeMan. The fish in the tank are 
object icons, each of which represents a to-do item, and the cat is an operation icon that 
appears when there are too many fish in the tank (the to-do list is too long). Figure 4 in 
the main text illustrates a time-sensitive visual sentence that changes its meaning with 
thme.<br>

<h3>Operators</h3>
Icons are combined using operators. The general form of binary operations is expressed 
as x<font size =-2>1 </font>op x<font size=-2>2</font>= x<font size=-2>3</font>, where the two icons x<font size=-2>1</font> and x<font size=-2>2</font> are
combined into x<font size=-2>3</font> using operator op. The operator op = (op<font size=-2>m</font>, op<font size=-2>p</font>), 
where op<font size=-2>m</font> is the logical operator, and op<font size=-2>p</font> is the physical operator. Using 
this expanded notation, we can write (x<font size=-2>m1</font>, x<font size=-2>p1</font>) op (x<font size=-2>m2</font>, x<font size=-2>
p2</font>) = ((x<font size=-2>m1</font> op<font size=-2>m</font> x<font size=-2>m2</font>), (x<font size=-2>p1</font> op<font size=-2>p</font> x<font size=-2>p2</font>)). In 
other words, the meaning part x<font size=-2>m1</font> and x<font size=-2>m2</font> are combined using the 
logical operator op<font size=-2>m</font>, and the physical part x<font size=-2>p1</font> and x<font size=-2>p2</font> are 
combined using the physical operator op<font size=-2>p</font>.<br>

Operators can be visible or invisible. Most system-defined spatial/temporal operators are 
invisible, whileas all user-defined operators are visible for the convenience of the user. 
For example, excluding the dialog box, the visual sentence in Figure A is the horizontal 
combination of three icons. Therefore, it can be expressed as:<br>

  (  CHILDREN hor SCHOOL_HOUSE ) hor SUNRISE<br>

where hor is an invisible operator denoting a horizontal combination. But if we look at 
Figure B, the cat is a visible operator denoting a process to be applied to the fish in the 
fish tank. An operation icon can be regarded as a visible operator.<br>

The four most useful domain-independent icon operators are ver, for vertical 
composition; hor, for horizontal composition; ov, for overlay; and con, for connect. ver, 
hor and ovl are usually invisible, and con is usually visible as a connecting line.<br>

The invisible icon operators are spatial operators and apply only to icons or ticons. The 
spatial composition of two icons or ticons is a complex icon. <br>

<h3>Representing meaning </h3>
To represent the meaning of an icon, we use either a frame or a conceptual graph, 
depending on the underlying semantic model of the application system being developed. 
Both are appropriate representations of meaning, and can be transformed into one 
another. For example, the SCHOOL_HOUSE icon in Figure A can be represented by the 
following frame: <br>

   Icon SCHOOL_HOUSE<br>
   WHO:            nil<br>
   DO:                study<br>
   WHERE:        school<br>
   WHEN:          nil<br>

In other words, the SCHOOL_HOUSE icon has the meaning <b>study</b> if it is in the DO 
location, or the meaning <b>school</b> in the WHERE location. Its meaning is "nil" if it is in 
the WHO or WHEN location. An equivalent linearized conceptual graph is as follows:<br>

   [Icon = SCHOOL_HOUSE]<br>
     --(sub)-->     [WHO = nil]<br>
     --(verb)->     [DO = study]<br>
     --(loc)-->     [WHERE = school]<br>
     --(time)->     [WHEN = nil]<br>

The meaning of a composite icon can be derived from the constituent icons, if we have 
the appropriate inference rules to combine the meanings of the constituent icons.  We 
have applied conceptual dependency theory to develop inference rules to combine frames 
[CHANG94b]. We have also adopted conceptual operators to combine conceptual graphs 
[CHANG89]. As a simple example, the merging of the frames for the icons in the visual 
sentence shown in Figure A will yield the frame:<br>

   Visual_Sentence vs1 <br>
   WHO:              children<br>
   DO:                 study<br>
   WHERE:         nil<br>
   WHEN:           morning<br>

We can derive this frame by merging the frames of the four icons using the following 
rule: <br>

      The ith slot gets the value of the corresponding slot of the ith icon.<br>

Thus the first slot with slot_name WHO gets the value <b>children</b> from the corresponding
slot of the first icon CHILDREN, the second slot with slot_name DO gets the value
"study" from the corresponding slot of the second icon SCHOOL_HOUSE, etc.<br>

<h3>Figures for the Appendix:</h3>

Figure A. This figure is a location-sensitive visual sentence that, when compared with the 
sentence in Figure 2 in the main text, shows how the placement of the <b>school</b> icon 
changes its meaning. Here the meaning is <b>The children study in the morning</b>. In Figure 
2, the meaning is <b>The children drive to school in the morning</b>. Such visual sentences 
can be used to specify to-do items for the time management personal digital assistant 
TimeMan. <br>

Figure B.  Content-Sensitive visual sentences (a) and (b) show the fish tank and cat 
metaphor for the time management personal digital assistant TimeMan. Each fish 
represents a to-do item. When the to-do list grows too long, the fish tank is 
overpopulated and the cat appears. The fish tank icon and cat operation icon have 
corresponding index cells receiving messages from these icons when they are changed by 
the user.
