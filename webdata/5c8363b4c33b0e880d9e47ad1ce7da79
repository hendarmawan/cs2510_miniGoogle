<h2>
Project:
Topic Detection and Tracking based Power Efficiency Web Server
</h2>
What I want to do in this project is to build a Web Server with Hot topic awareness powered by the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT).
Below is a list of things that I want to do.
<p>
<h3>a)	User request handler</h3>
A component that responsible for collect the entire user request of the web server and send the collected data to the TDT component.
<h3>b)	Topic Detection and Tracking </h3>
It responsible for finding the trend in a stream of user requests, and makes decision in tuning up the server cluster.
ie.
Send the reducing the power supply instruction to the group of servers that working on one topic when TDT component detect that this topic is not hot any more.
<ul>
<h3>a.	Slow Intelligence System</h3>
The base framework for TDT who is going to use different methods to predict the trend, with the help of SIS, it can gradually improve performance over time.
<h3>b.	Knowledge Base</h3>
It is the core database to help SIS to select the best method over time.
Generally speaking, it will contain two knowledge bases.
<ul>
<h3>1.	Evaluation result knowledge base</h3>
The result about what method we have choice last time.
<h3>2.	Sampled historical record knowledge base</h3>
Record for past predict trend and the actual hot trend at that time.
So that the Eliminator can pick up the method and compare with these records to see which method has the best result
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>c)	Dispatcher</h3>
Get the instruction from the TDT server and also the topic (marked with hot or cold), then send the according instruction to the group that dealing with this topic.

See whether you can incorporate the graphic tool
you did for CS2310 into this project.
