<h2>Description:</h2> 

<blockquote>
Human conversational partners are able, at least to a certain extent,
      to detect the speaker's or listener's emotional state and may attempt
      to respond to it accordingly.  When instead one of the interlocutors
      is a computer a number of questions arise, such as the following: To
      what extent are dialogue systems able to simulate such behaviors?  Can
      we learn the mechanisms of emotional behaviors from observing and
      analyzing the behavior of human speakers?  How can emotions be
      automatically recognized from a user's mimics, gestures and speech?
      What possibilities does a dialogue system have to express emotions
      itself?  And, very importantly, would emotional system behavior be
      desirable at all?

This course will explore topics in the area of Affective Spoken
Dialogue Systems. The course will both introduce foundational
areas such as Affective Computing, Emotional Speech, and Spoken Dialogue
Systems, and present recent work addressing their
integration. While the course will primarily be
presented from a Speech and Natural Language Processing perspective,
papers from related areas will also be discussed.
Topics to be covered will include:

<ul>
<li>emotional databases, annotation schemes, and speech processing tools
<li> emotion recognition from text and speech
<li> synthesis of emotional text and speech
<li> affective conversational agents
<li> applications (e.g., intelligent tutoring systems, customer care call centers)
<li> evaluation   
</ul>

<H2>Prerequisites:</H2>

Graduate-level courses in Natural Language Processing or Artificial Intelligence, or permission of instructor. <p>

<p> Because in-class discussions are an important part of this course,
absences are strongly discouraged. Even if an absence is unavoidable,
you are still responsible for making arrangements to turn in the
assignments on time. 
Late assignments will not be accepted.
<b>No extensions</b> will be given, except in case of
extraordinary and <b>documented</b> circumstances (e.g., hospitalization).

<h2>Academic Integrity:</h2> 

<p>If you include material from any source in
your presentation and/or projects, you must acknowledge it. Your
presentations and projects should represent your (and your partner's,
if applicable) original work.

<h2>Students with Disabilities:</h2> 

<p>If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and
Disability Resources and Services, 216 William Pitt Union, (412)
648-7890/(412) 383-7355 (TTY), as early as possible in the term.  DRS
will verify your disability and determine reasonable accomodations for
this course.
