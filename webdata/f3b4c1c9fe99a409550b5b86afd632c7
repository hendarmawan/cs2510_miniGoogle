<h1>Definition of an Ontology</h1>
</center>
<h2>
In Computer Science, an Ontology is a
formal representation of a set of
concepts within a domain, and the
relationship between these concepts.
<p>
It is used to reason about the properties
of the domain, and may be used to
define that domain.
<p>
An ontology provides a shared vocabulary,
which may be used to model the domain -
the type of objects and their properties
and relations.
