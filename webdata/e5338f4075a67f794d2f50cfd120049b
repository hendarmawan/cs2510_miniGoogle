   <h1>Conclusions</h1>
   <br></br>
<p>Image search engines are a relatively new idea that can be used in many
areas in the world. They can help in searching for general categories
of a topic, as well as patterns or specific ideas.</p>
<p>Text-bases image searches are the most common type that have been
implemented, but content-based image searches will surely be available for
public use in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Both Google and SIMPLIcity are strong steps in the right direction of
where image search engines should be headed. Google is both reliable and
fast, and SIMPLIcity's functionality of matching image content is much
more precise and reliable of an idea than searching for surrounding
text.</p>
